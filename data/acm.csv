2024,A Dynamically Evolving Multicultural Escape Suitcase Travelling a Participatory Journey,"Becker, Katja and Winschiers-Theophilus, Heike and Maasz, Donovan and Auala, Selma and Itenge, Helvi and Isaacs, Joseph-David and Peter, Kaulyaalalwa and Goagoses, Naska",10.1145/3661456.3666048,https://doi.org/10.1145/3661456.3666048,Association for Computing Machinery,"Proceedings of the Participatory Design Conference 2024: Situated Actions, Doctoral Colloquium, PDC Places, Communities - Volume 3",,"Escape rooms have gained popularity across the globe, be it for entertainment, team building, or learning purposes. Solving puzzles has intrigued humanity since ancient times and playing games together facilitated intercultural encounters, encouraging mutual learning. This situated action builds on the idea of a mobile escape room within a suitcase, which when traveling shares previous encounters and collects new puzzles, thereby ever evolving. A suitcase will arrive in Sibu, Malaysia, with augmented reality stickers that entail puzzles created in Namibia. Visitors need to solve the puzzles to open the suitcase, which contains treats from Namibia, as well as materials to create new puzzles. Visitors participate in creating their own cultural puzzles, upload them to the augmented reality application, and thereby contribute to a new multicultural escape suitcase. The puzzles can also be played back at home, and the suitcase will continue evolving as it travels."
2024,Navigating Cultural Diversity: Barriers and Benefits in Multicultural Agile Software Development Teams,"Welsch, Daniel and Burk, Luisa and M\""{o}tefindt, David and Neumann, Michael",10.1145/3605098.3635988,https://doi.org/10.1145/3605098.3635988,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the 39th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing,,"Context: Social aspects are of high importance for being successful using agile methods in software development. People are influenced by their cultural imprint, as the underlying cultural values are guiding us in how we think and act. Thus, one may assume that in multicultural agile software development teams, cultural characteristics influence the result in terms of quality of the team work and consequently, the product to be delivered. Objective: We aim to identify barriers and benefits that may arise in multicultural agile software development teams to provide valuable strategies for both researchers and practitioners faced with barriers or potential benefits of cultural diversity. Method: The single-case study comprising two units of analysis (agile software development teams). Our approach further include a mixed-method design consisting quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. Results: First, our results suggest that the cultural characteristics at the team level need to be analyzed individually in intercultural teams. Second, we identified key benefits regarding cultural characteristics such as a individual team subculture that fits agile values like open communication. Third, we derived strategies supporting the benefits of cultural diversity in agile software development teams. Conclusion: Our findings show, that a deeper understanding of cultural influences in multicultural agile software development teams is needed. Based on the results, we already prepare future work to validate the results in other industries."
2024,Designing for Harm Reduction: Communication Repair for Multicultural Users' Voice Interactions,"Wenzel, Kimi and Kaufman, Geoff",10.1145/3613904.3642900,https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3642900,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the 2024 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,,"Voice assistants’ inability to serve people-of-color and non-native English speakers has largely been documented as a quality-of-service harm. However, little work has investigated what downstream harms propagate from this poor service. How does poor usability materially manifest and affect users’ lives? And what interaction designs might help users recover from these effects? We identify 6 downstream harms that propagate from quality-of-service harms in voice assistants. Through interviews and design activities with 16 multicultural participants, we unveil these 6 harms, outline how multicultural users uniquely personify their voice assistant, and suggest how these harms and personifications may affect their interactions. Lastly, we employ techniques from psychology on communication repair to contribute suggestions for harm-reducing repair that may be implemented in voice technologies. Our communication repair strategies include: identity affirmations (intermittent frequency), cultural sensitivity, and blame redirection. This work shows potential for a harm-repair framework to positively influence voice interactions."

This paper reports on findings from a global software engineering course taught at three universities in Japan, Germany, and Indonesia. Questionnaire and interview data gathered ex-ante (before) and ex-post (after) the semester about cultural dimensions and UML usage are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The perceived importance of cultural dimensions was compared to previous two-university classes. Experience reports from instructors are described. Unique dynamics in students’ perception of cultural dimensions could be observed. UML challenges self-reported are consistent with previous research findings. An ex-ante to ex-post comparison supports the implementation of real-world projects taught in PBL-style. These findings together are presented as best practices and lessons learned."
2025,Adapting Communication Styles in Health Chatbot using Large Language Models to Support Family Caregivers from Multicultural Backgrounds,"Baik, Rebekah Lee and Lee, Stephanie and Xie, Serena Jinchen and Liao, Wang and Hwang, Elina H. and Yuwen, Weichao",10.1145/3706599.3719711,https://doi.org/10.1145/3706599.3719711,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,,"Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of increasingly sophisticated AI chatbots, yet these systems rarely consider the cultural context in their interactions. However, individuals from different cultural backgrounds may have distinct communication preferences when interacting with healthcare providers, which can affect therapeutic alliances. This paper presents a technical framework for developing culturally sensitive therapeutic chatbots that systematically adapt to different communication styles. We developed a two-agent system: a therapist agent providing problem-solving therapy, and a communication style modifier agent that adjusts these responses according to six communication styles: Authoritative, Concise, Conversationally Dominant, Informal, Sentimental, and Talkative style. An experimental study demonstrated that our system successfully produced perceivable differences in communication styles, with adapted responses receiving significantly higher style-specific ratings compared to unadapted responses. These results suggest that LLM-based therapeutic chatbots can be effectively modified to exhibit distinct communication styles, laying the groundwork for developing culturally adaptive therapeutic chatbots."

Macao's Multicultural Vocational Education and Training (MVET) is one of the important pillars of the One Base development plan. From this One Base, Macao will serve as a base for exchange and cooperation to promote a moderately diversified economy in which Chinese culture is the mainstream and diverse cultures coexist. This study analyzes how to build Macao's MVET center and utilizes a semi-structured interview method with 20 interviewees including professors, entrepreneurs, and government officials. The study then uses thematic analysis to divide the topics into 3 core training project categories: professional training enterprises, offline branch training centers, and online cloud training centers. Macao's MVET center should have the full support of all parties and can be divided into three aspects: first, building a professional training enterprise that is privately owned, university supported, government aided, and has association participation; second, developing an offline branch training center in the Guangdong-Macao in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin and providing multicultural courses for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area; third, building a multicultural training cloud platform and providing bilingual training for the Belt and Road countries, particularly Portuguese-speaking countries. This study is an integrated analysis of Macao's MVET offline and online centers and provides a sound foundation for future research on Macao's MVET center. It would be of interest to scholars and policymakers, as well as enterprises."

Self-presentation within such environments affects how students interact with learning content and with each other. We explore how anonymity/identifiability in user profile design impacts student interactions in a large multicultural classroom across two geographical locations. After triangulating 150,000 online interactions with questionnaires and focus groups, we provide three major findings. First, being identifiable had a significant impact on how students accessed and rated content created by their peers. Second, when identifiable, cultural differences became more prominent, leading some students to avoid content created by classmates of certain nationalities. Finally, when students interacted with their real identities, there were significant and negative gender effects which were absent when students were anonymous. These findings contribute to our understanding of social dynamics within multicultural learning environments, and raise practical implications for tool design."

In multilingual teams, however, it is often challenging for nonnative-speaking members (NNS) of the team to fully understand the humor shared among native speakers (NS). In an interview study with 28 NNS, we identified common sources of confusion in humorous interactions. Our study also revealed that the (mis)alignment of people's assumptions of others’ knowledge is key to failed humor and its consequences. NNS felt that NS often assumed everyone shared the knowledge required to understand their humor; thus, cultural references unfamiliar to NNS were a dominant source of confusion. On the other hand, NNS often felt ignorant for not knowing the references required to understand NS humor, as they assumed all the references unfamiliar to them must be generic knowledge known by all NS. We propose design ideas for better alignment of common ground assumptions between NS and NNS to facilitate humor-related communication and alleviate possible negative consequence of failed humor."

Aiming at a higher level of internationalization and having in mind that students could gain from an intensive and multicultural experience ISEP organized its first Engineering for Sustainable Development (E4SD) Summer Course, in July 2014. With a set of modules taught by experienced teachers in different topics of sustainability, the course had a problem based learning (PBL) approach and was organized in a very informal model. A total of 8 Korean and 8 Portuguese students from different areas of scientific knowledge attended this course and could interact and develop ties with each other and the teachers involved in the course, while learning and applying the fundamental skills on sustainability. In what concerns the approach used by students from different countries to solve the sustainability problem that was launched for discussion (The Rehabilitation of Historic Cities - The Case of Porto UNESCO World Heritage Site: A Sustainable Development Challenge) it was noticed a clear difference between the two cultures. Whereas the young Korean students did not seem to care with the heritage behind a building or an historic city, the Portuguese students, used to live in a historic city, proposed a much more conservative approach. However, both the students could interact and understand the other side of the problem, reaching a consensual proposal. Finally the Korean students came to the conclusion that it was of interest to preserve Porto history. The fact that Korea is a very different country and that Korean culture is significantly different from the European one, could have triggered cultural issues. Nevertheless, the young generations are prone to change and adaptation to new situations, what allows for the resolution of any possible conflict. The PBL approach allowed for a more dynamic and informal learning environment. This revealed attractive for the young Korean students who were gaining different skills in this Summer Course as a prize for their good results in their formal learning courses. On the other hand, for the Portuguese teachers the E4SD Summer Course represented an opportunity to interact with a larger group of students with the same different culture, which is different from interacting with only one or two students coming from Europe under Erasmus mobility, in a very short and intensive contact period."

The tool addresses multiculturalism, by presenting children with story elements from different cultures. We reflected on how to create visual elements that both represent a given culture and foster the children's imagination and creativity. It is key to create eye-catching and imagination-inducing visuals, that can be achieved through an exploratory and iterative process. It is crucial to undertake extensive research to learn about and understand the history and meanings behind each culture, to avoid stereotypes and other representation clich\'{e}s. Whenever possible, it is important to involve people raised in each culture in the design process, since their contribution is grounded in real life experience and will translate into valuable insights."

In this work, we aim at exploring and analyzing the human perception and trust in artificial intelligence. To this end, we collected personal opinions concerning juicy topics in artificial intelligence literature, meaning the interpretability of black-box models, and the reliability of autonomous systems. The analysis has been conducted on different applications, including medical and cybersecurity domains."

Traits like trustworthiness and humanness have long been evaluated, but less so for traits like fun. In this study we evaluate fun in four conversational agents with a mix of menial tasks, games, and free play in the US and India on voice and text-based platforms. Our research explores user sentiment of fun in an A.I. personality, implications of fun personality on voice-based and text-based agents, and the perception of a fun A.I. personality in two culturally distinct markets. We used a mixed method approach to evaluate these objectives with 44 participants. Our results end with design principles for creating fun in artificial intelligence: 1) balance fun through conversational humor and goal-oriented actions, 2) create fun experiences through playful interactions, 3) convey fun through platform specific expressions like tone of voice or visual gestures and emojis, and 4) be inclusively fun by being culturally relevant so your conversational agent translates across borders."

Researchers and engineers have pushed technical boundaries in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, location inference, and wearable computing. But what do people with visual disabilities imagine as their own technological future? To explore this question, we developed and carried out tactile ideation workshops with participants in the UK and India. Our participants generated a large and diverse set of ideas, most focusing on ways to meet needs related to social interaction. In some cases, this was a matter of recognizing people. In other cases, they wanted to be able to participate in social situations without foregrounding their disability. It was striking that this finding was consistent across UK and India despite substantial cultural and infrastructural differences. In this paper, we describe a new technique for working with people with visual disabilities to imagine new technologies that are tuned to their needs and aspirations. Based on our experience with these workshops, we provide a set of social dimensions to consider in the design of new AI technologies: social participation, social navigation, social maintenance, and social independence. We offer these social dimensions as a starting point to forefront users' social needs and desires as a more deliberate consideration for assistive technology design."

Through a mixed-methods approach, employing a seven-day diary study followed by one-on-one interviews with seven OR app users in India, we explore their experiences in depth. Our findings highlight the nuances of what interdependence looks like in a multicultural, Indian society, as people navigate public and private spheres with a camera-based assistive technology designed for independent, western contexts. We argue for the necessity to design assistive technologies following the interdependence framework that accommodates the social and cultural context of the Global South. Additionally, we propose design guidelines for assistive technologies in community-oriented societies, emphasizing community-centered approaches, cultural alignment, and locally adaptable designs."

However, this same characteristic makes them a powerful tool for disseminating social bias and prejudice. Such harmful memes can perpetuate stereotypes, foster discrimination, and exacerbate social divisions in a wide variety of social dimensions, including race, religion, sexual orientation, and more. Recognizing this issue, AI Singapore has launched the Online Safety Prize Challenge to stimulate research of technologies that can effectively detect harmful memes, particularly in Singapore's multicultural and multilingual context. Given the country's linguistic diversity, these memes could be created and spread in various languages, including English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. This adds an additional layer of complexity to the detection process, as the memes not only embody the multimodal nature combining visual imagery with text to convey messages that are often nuanced and context-dependent but also do so across different cultural and linguistic contexts."

Overall, a fundamental need has been identified in the PD community to raise previously unheard global voices in design and development work, and to bring various underrepresented stakeholders together. On the other hand, the rapid adoption of various synchronous and asynchronous communication methods through collaborative online tools offers opportunities for more dispersed and more diverse PD research teams, settings and processes. This raises new possibilities for bridging global distances and bringing various stakeholders together for the purposes of conducting multicultural, multi-site PD. Importantly, while there exists extensive research literatures both on PD, on remote ethnography and on Computer-Supported Collaborative Work, we posit that these literatures have not been brought together; nor have the practices and methodologies of these communities been sufficiently jointly explored to support the goals of multisite, multicultural PD. In this workshop, we strive to bridge this gap in knowledge through exploring the opportunities of conducting hybrid multi-site Participatory Design (HMPD) research through synchronous and asynchronous present–telepresent participatory methods, and to share issues, challenges, opportunities, methods and empirical examples pertaining to this as a goal."

Digital storytelling, particularly using smart tangibles, offers a structured, interactive and engaging environment for children with ASD allowing for repetition, offering feedback with visual supports, and giving the child more authority over the learning experience. This study presents a co-designed approach to digital storytelling activities with smart tangibles for autism therapy, aimed at enhancing multiple social and behavioral skills. Through co-design sessions with therapists, activity flows and scenarios were developed to target specific skill improvements. These include free play exploration, positive stimulus introduction, fostering cooperation to address disturbances, and incorporating magical objects to facilitate peer turn-taking. Additionally, real-life connections were emphasized to promote emotional regulation and multicultural understanding while further activities are designed to overcome routine issues, build tolerance to change, and enhance cognitive structuring. Feasibility was demonstrated through integration into therapy sessions of five children, where therapists independently utilized the system, fostering immersive and interactive storytelling experiences. Overall, the co-designed activities offer insights into enhancing therapy interventions for children with ASD beyond specific contexts, contributing to the broader design of autism therapy activities."

This paper discusses the benefits from the perspectives of students who are the ultimate beneficiaries, based on a case study on the specific implementation of International College Beijing (ICB), China Agricultural University. 200 valid samples of students' satisfaction are collected by a questionnaire survey consisting of 3 primary indexes: Multicultural Exposure, Critical Thinking, and English Competence, and 12 secondary indexes. On the basis of the data, this paper constructs an objective model to evaluate the overall satisfaction rate by entropy weight method (EWM) that is giving 12 indexes weight to obtain the weighted sum, and turns the calculation result into a hundred-mark system. In this research, according to the evaluation system model, the weighted satisfaction scores in ICB are attained and the average satisfaction score is 0.785. Students' satisfaction plays the role of an indicator to explore the benefit of promoting internationalizing higher education in ICB. Besides, through quantitative analysis, the satisfaction scores of ICB students are discussed in specific cases. Students majoring in Finance have the highest satisfaction scores while those majoring in Communication have the lowest satisfaction, and satisfaction basically increases with the years staying in ICB. Students are more satisfied with English Competence and less satisfied with Multicultural Exposure. Results like these can help relevant local higher education departments and supervisors investigate further through the specific implementations and the curriculum design to sustainably improve their educational performance."

However, video-meetings experience challenges originating from human emotions. Therefore, emotional competence, the ability to perceive, understand, and regulate emotions, is of the highest relevance. With limited transfer capacity of emotional information and various communication challenges, developing emotional competence, however, is complex. To overcome this complexity, we present TeamSpiritous, an individual, retrospective emotional competence development system for video-meetings. TeamSpiritous allows to upload and analyze recorded video-meetings on emotional processes and provides support for individual development of emotional competence.We evaluated TeamSpiritous quantitatively and qualitatively in a six-week, longitudinal field study with 47 participants from China and Germany. Results of our study show that intra- and interpersonal emotional competence significantly increased over time for the whole sample. In particular, intrapersonal emotion regulation and interpersonal emotion perception and understanding improved. Since remote work video-meetings are often multicultural, we also investigated cultural differences and observed in our results that the effects of TeamSpiritous exist beyond cultural backgrounds (China, Germany). With our work, we contribute with the design of TeamSpiritous and understanding of its effects on emotional competence development."

2023,ChatGPT Perpetuates Gender Bias in Machine Translation and Ignores Non-Gendered Pronouns: Findings across Bengali and Five other Low-Resource Languages,"Ghosh, Sourojit and Caliskan, Aylin",10.1145/3600211.3604672,https://doi.org/10.1145/3600211.3604672,Association for Computing Machinery,"Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,"In this multicultural age, language translation is one of the most performed tasks, and it is becoming increasingly AI-moderated and automated. As a novel AI system, ChatGPT claims to be proficient in machine translation tasks and in this paper, we put that claim to the test. Specifically, we examine ChatGPT’s accuracy in translating between English and languages that exclusively use gender-neutral pronouns. We center this study around Bengali, the 7th most spoken language globally, but also generalize our findings across five other languages: Farsi, Malay, Tagalog, Thai, and Turkish. We find that ChatGPT perpetuates gender defaults and stereotypes assigned to certain occupations (e.g., man = doctor, woman = nurse) or actions (e.g., woman = cook, man = go to work), as it converts gender-neutral pronouns in languages to ‘he’ or ‘she’. We also observe ChatGPT completely failing to translate the English gender-neutral singular pronoun ‘they’ into equivalent gender-neutral pronouns in other languages, as it produces translations that are incoherent and incorrect. While it does respect and provide appropriately gender-marked versions of Bengali words when prompted with gender information in English, ChatGPT appears to confer a higher respect to men than to women in the same occupation. We conclude that ChatGPT exhibits the same gender biases which have been demonstrated for tools like Google Translate or MS Translator, as we provide recommendations for a human centered approach for future designers of AI systems that perform machine translation to better accommodate such low-resource languages."

It pursues the ontological breakthrough of personality development, respects the return of multicultural values, seeks the original positioning of harmonious development and the ecological vision of returning to the world of life. Its value appeal is mainly based on the integration of comprehensive evaluation, the linkage of multi-subject evaluation and the achievement of the comprehensive evaluation benefits, which forms a relatively systematic curriculum value. From the perspective of the improvement-oriented evaluation model, school educational authorities should be demand-oriented; They should implement the ""curriculum standards"", insist on the principle of adjusting measures to local conditions, and tap the depth of continuous evaluation; They should optimize the curriculum evaluation system and enhance the process evaluation; Moreover, they should also combine qualitative and quantitative evaluation to improve the validity."

Therefore, one of the challenges such outreach programs pose is further stereotyping of students who are interested in computer science, by presenting them as people who ought to be hyper-intelligent and very much focused on computers with no social skills. Realizing the above, and wanting to attract a diverse audience to study computer science, we developed a one-day workshop which showcases the interdisciplinary nature of computer science and the various ways computing can help students discover and solve societal problems. We chose multiculturalism, cyber security and air pollution as the context of our computational thinking activities. This paper describes our experiences in developing and teaching the workshops that runs three to five times a year, hosted either in our institute or at local schools. Regardless of students' previous STEM experiences and socioeconomic statuses, both students and teachers reported that the knowledge gained enabled them to either create a computer program or a robot and also led to a better understanding of how computers can be used in daily life. In other words, the workshop successfully opened the minds and perspectives of the middle school and high school students on computer science. Additionally, over time, we also observed an increased number of students and schools participating in such workshops."

While being transversal in nature, the cultural component finds the ideal scenario for its exploration in the foreign language classroom. To date, many recent studies have addressed the issue of culture teaching and provided theoretical models from an intercultural approach. However, the integration of cultural aspects in actual practice is yet deemed superficial and incidental. This paper attempts to examine the perceptions of both EFL secondary school teachers and learners on the role of culture to identify the potential misalignment of the teaching practices and learners’ needs and motivations for culture learning. In light of the results of a survey that supports the expectations of the literature reviewed, several pedagogical recommendations will be provided for more effective implementation of culture in the EFL classroom."

EPS aims to prepare future engineers to think and act globally, by adopting project-based learning and teamwork methodologies, fostering the development of complementary skills and addressing sustainability and multiculturalism. In 2016, two EPS@ISEP teams embraced the challenge of building a robust, inexpensive, modular, comfortable and safe wooden / metallic dome using simple techniques and sustainable materials. This challenge is demanding - requires a multidisciplinary and user-centred design - as well as rewarding - contributes to satisfy the right to adequate, safe and affordable housing as stated in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The goal is to solve the problem in a modular and sustainable way, i.e., by using repetitive linear elements made of locally available materials. This approach aims to dramatically decrease the cost of production and shipping, simplify the construction process and address the needs of the dome users. Although geodesic cross-linked structures have been studied for some time, their design requires the involvement of all stakeholders as well as a team which understands and integrates the contributions from areas such as electronics, mechanics, civil, environmental or materials engineering. The project-based learning approach fosters, on the one hand, autonomy, responsibility and the ability to make sound technical-scientific choices and, on the other hand, develops teamwork, sustainable development and personal and cross-cultural communication skills, while promoting the emergence of innovative, creative and sometimes audacious solutions, typical of the youth."

However, uncertainty is present in any DH endeavour, in various types and degrees, due to the very nature of both humanist research and the intervention of computers to enable such kind of research methodologies. On the one hand, information sources need to be converted into digital form and, on the other hand, the resulting digital objects are processed to obtain summaries, geographic and temporal distributions, networks, patterns, etc., that are presented to and interpreted by the researchers or users of the DH projects. From the digitalization to the interpretation, both the computational and cognitive steps involved are subject to uncertainty. The track ""Uncertainty in Digital Humanities"" of the Sixth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality (TEEM 2018), tries to bring together researchers in Digital Humanities and reflect on the opportunities and challenges related to the way in which uncertainty can be better understood and pave the way towards appropriate methods and tools of dealing with uncertainty that improve the support to humanists when generating new knowledge."

The present study is classified within two paradigms; School Effectiveness and Educational Improvement, which have been treated separately, although currently, the research tends to integrate both perspectives. Our goal is study how schools attend to diversity students, because the literature suggests student achievement is related to inclusive education at school. Previously, we will detect high effectiveness schools through an analysis of the PISA 2018 results. Therefore, we investigate this relationship by the influence of culturally responsive school leadership, in order to discover effective culturally responsive practices which improve student's achievement."

They encompass product catalogs of e-commerce, general-purpose knowledge bases and numerous domain-specific category systems. The ""common denominator"" of all these is their enormous diversity, which makes it infeasible to combine multiple taxonomies for ad-hoc tasks. To support the alignment of independently created Web taxonomies, we introduce the ACROSS framework. For mapping categories across different taxonomies, ACROSS harnesses instance-level features as well as distant supervision from an intermediate source like multiple Wikipedia editions. Our experiments with heterogeneous taxonomies for different domains demonstrate the viability of our approach and improvement over state-of-the-art baselines."

The taxonomic type systems of such knowledge bases are often highly heterogeneous, as they reflect different cultures, languages, and intentions of usage. We present a novel method to the problem of multi-cultural knowledge alignment, which maps each node of a source taxonomy onto a ranked list of most suitable nodes in the target taxonomy. We model this task as combinatorial optimization problems, using integer linear programming and quadratic programming. The quality of the computed alignments is evaluated, using large heterogeneous taxonomies about book categories."

Thus, the concept of Sustainable Development is gaining increasing importance.Although changing attitudes and behavior is known to take time and be hard, it can be promoted by education at all levels, with potential cascading impact results if implemented in the Higher Education system. In fact, near future young professionals are being educated in this system, and whatever they learn today will certainly be replicated tomorrow, not only in their personal but also in their professional life. Furthermore, although they are young and inexperienced, their ingenuity can help disrupt some established ideas and practices that hinder the changes needed to promote the common well-being.In this Track of TEEM’20, it was presented and discussed a series of different approaches implemented by professors of Higher Education in different fields of knowledge. It was shown that the concepts of Sustainable Development and Sustainability can be well assimilated by young adults by using well thought recreational pedagogical activities. Nevertheless, all the intervenient have highlighted the need to include a feedback loop as a way to adapt and change the activities according to the students’ prior experience and motivation, as well as to the available means and their individual styles."

The team embraced the idea of repurposing coffee leftovers to cultivate oyster mushrooms and benefited from the background diversity of the team members as well as from newly acquired marketing, sustainability and design ethics skills to consolidate and strengthen the overall feasibility of the project. The project was set to design, develop and test grey oyster mushroom growth kits with an automated monitoring system, using coffee grounds as growing substrate and complying with the applicable regulations and pre-defined requirements. The ulterior aims of the project were to reconnect people with the food they eat and to disseminate sustainable food production processes, which are not only healthy but environmentally friendly. To achieve these goals, the team developed a circular economy business model where grey oyster mushroom growth kits reuse coffee grounds as growing beds and food buckets as containers. The designed growth kits include a controlled fruiting chamber with an integrated monitoring system. This allows easy domestic cultivation, monitoring through a smart phone. Moreover, the proposed solution contemplates information sharing on the mushroom cultivation process, monitoring system and recipes as well as the maintenance of a dedicated discussion forum. Tests have been conducted to test the concept, cultivation process, monitoring system and fruiting chamber from the incubation of mycelium all the way to the harvesting. Results show the feasibility of creating a business based on the devised concept."

Humanity has an absolutely vital dependence on a set of natural and artificial resources. The advancement of knowledge needed to adequately manage these resources has traditionally been achieved through specialization. In this strategy of dividing and ruling, what was gained in depth was lost in coverage. Yet, the most recent problems are intensely interdisciplinary, revealing that the previous specialization strategy is currently not wrong, but clearly insufficient. Strangely (or not), various courses in higher education continued to follow the traditional specialization strategy. As a result of this state-of-affairs, several conferences currently exist, both in the field of Education or in the field of Sustainability, but it has been particularly difficult to attract participants to deepen the theme of Teaching Sustainability. As an attempt to contribute to clarifying the needs of the present and future, this TEEM’21 track presents itself as a space for presenting results and debating works and strategies that involve both domains: Teaching and Sustainability."

The world could not be paralyzed in all scenarios, for this reason, it was necessary to act and get to incorporate information and communication technologies (ICT) into daily activities. The educational context was one which incorporates and uses of ICT is most reflected, which had to make a stop along the way, to think of how it would be implemented communication strategies to interact with students and be able to continue with education at home. In this way, ICTs began to be more relevant through Web tools and, to be incorporated, used, and adapted to keep the educational process active. In this way, individual work was also privileged, and even more collaborative one allowing Collective Intelligences to be empowered in education, by developing favorable spaces to home learning. This research project addressed the research question “How to promote the development of Collective Intelligence supported by web tools?” where the intervention and relevance of the web tools were understood in depth, as well as their incorporation, use, adaptation, and contribution to the development of the educational processes; whereas teachers, students and now family, they have played an active role facing this health emergency caused by COVID-19. The interactions and reflections made around these tools, allow to strengthen the competences, the collaborative and cooperative learning, which increases the group work team. One of the purposes was to interact with Web tools to strengthen the development of Collective Intelligences, the educational process conceived in a decentralized context allows to generate a technological transformation in education. This has allowed teachers, students, and parents to act in collective environments, in this sense, the expanded open classroom education that works collectively has taken a considerable enough of strength, where everyone acts, reflects and participates in active roles. The research was worked with the methodological approach of qualitative type, which allowed to know about the reality that surrounds the educational process, by observing to describe and explain the attitudes and academic developments of students in situations identified in a theoretical-practical context. One of the results was the interaction and the way who works emotional intelligence was addressed, when students and teachers are working as a team, in developing Collective Intelligences. The project has been advanced, thanks to the observation as an instrument that has made it possible to demonstrate the applicability of web tools to strengthen the development of Collective Intelligences in the educational process."

Through this work were established that most authors designed a new set of methods for the implementation of the signature pedagogy in the educational practice in order to reflect the unique character of any professional activity and the meaning of human capacity in personal professional development. In the study were characterized three dimensions of the signature pedagogy in musical education including surface, deep and implicit structure. These dimensions were implemented by the means of SPOC (Small Private Online Course), which structure included lectures, internet resources, collection of students' works for exchanging of experience and collaborate work in the research area. The study involved 306 from first to fourth grades students of music teacher bachelor's degree program from two universities: Kazan Federal University (Kazan) (156 students) and I.Yakovlev Chuvash State Pedagogical University (Cheboksary) (150 students). The experimental data were collected from tests results and analysis of questionnaires by quantitative and statistical methods. The results of the level of musical knowledge and value orientations were increased in the student's group who learned by online course based on signature pedagogy, but not in the traditional group. Based on the experimental research work were concluded that online learning course based on SPOC is a perspective way for developing education system."

2021,Experts’ Judgment for Evaluation of an E-Learning Entrepreneurship Course in Higher Education,"Portuguez Castro, May and G\'{o}mez Zerme\~{n}o, Marcela Georgina",10.1145/3486011.3486530,https://doi.org/10.1145/3486011.3486530,Association for Computing Machinery,Ninth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality (TEEM'21),,"Today's education is in accelerated digital transformation, mainly promoted by the crisis with COVID-19. Face-to-face courses have had to be switched to virtual mode without many educational institutions being fully prepared for this change, which causes problems, especially with the quality of the courses offered. Therefore, strategies should emerge to evaluate the use of Information Technologies (ICTs) in education. One of these methodologies is expert judgment, so this work aims to present an assessment of an e-learning entrepreneurship course conducted by nine experts at a university in Mexico to analyze whether the course proposal was appropriate to achieve students' learning objectives. The results obtained showed that the course activities are appropriate for fulfilling the proposed objectives and the structure and variety of content were suitable for fostering the entrepreneurial spirit in students. It is considered that educational institutions can use this strategy to evaluate courses before implementation by experienced professionals in the study taking into consideration the current requirements caused by COVID-19 and that will remain with its effects for a more prolonged period."

However, little research has been done on modeling content in education by estimating different content characteristics using probabilistic methods. Based on the existing gap in this area, this paper presents a model for exercises using probabilistic methods with interactions carried out by students to obtain content characteristics and their relationship such as the number of attempts, grade, and time spent related with student efficiency. Simulations were performed to train the model and find the different curves that best characterize the exercises based on programmatically generated interactions. This model allows the teacher to redesign the exercises to improve the student’s learning process."

PBL has been traditionally associated with student engagement and providing good results in terms of user experience. However, the actual trend in technical studies shows a reduction in interest and fewer students in technical qualifications. To correct this, authors have devised a project that motivates students to enroll in technical degrees through PBL: a contest based in the construction of solar vehicles designed by preuniversity students, to later carry out a public competition in which to reward the best projects. In this way, the authors intend to increase the engagement of preuniversity students with technical studies while promoting ecological awareness. The necessary care of the environment has opened a window of opportunities for engineers and scientists, since the vast majority of products must be redesigned or adapted to a new regulatory framework stricter with the care of the environment, so these new opportunities require qualified engineers. Moreover, sustainability policies must have a strong educational component. This paper describes the project carried out at the University of Huelva together with preuniversity schools, as well as some of the results obtained in 2018 and 2019 editions of this project."

These RLs are part of a didactic concept based on the approach of problem-based learning. In problem-oriented exercises, the students plan, implement and check their solutions in remote experiments. The first RL offers eight experiments for the students based on PLC and microcontroller programming, whereas the second RL provides seven demonstrations on task scheduling. The second RL’s unique feature is a horizontal didactic reduction from a calculation process to a task of a crane robot. The RLs are accessed via a self-developed RL management system. The evaluation of the field test shows that students’ motivation has increased and the link between theory and practice has been improved. Furthermore, the students’ exam results have improved. However, students criticize the additional time required for the remote experiments."

Despite the growing interest in this matter, it is still an underdeveloped topic, which requires further research. Postural control, the workplace ergonomics, the improvement of the equipment, or the training, are elements that still need to be enhanced to avoid, or at least limit, the pathologies that may be developed due to the practice of surgery.Methods: Different researches have been carried out to obtain the knowledge base. For this, a search array has been developed based in the main keywords in this field: “surgery”, “ergonomics” or “musculoskeletal disorders”, in the main scientific free search engine PUBMED (Medline). The selection criteria has been based on articles in English language published no longer than 5 years ago, that is, from May 2016. All the references presented in this document have been read and reviewed in detail. The PRISMA methodology has been used to present the results.Results: From the search carried out, 13 articles have been selected, 8 reviews and 5 specific studies, which present the main physical symptoms suffered by surgeons during an operation, neck, back and shoulder most commonly mentioned as the main affected areas for pain, discomfort or injuries in most of the surgery typologies.Conclusion: Despite the diseases associated with their activity, surgeons are not prone to treat their pathologies with a specialist. Preventive actions, such as training, microbreaks during surgery, or ergonomic improvement of the position, are considered vital to enhance the working conditions of the surgeon and his team. Additionally, the development of the equipment in the operating room could meet the growing demand of enhancements in the surgical field."

The performance of individuals in an organization is intrinsically related to their motivation to perform a certain task. This motivation may emerge from different perspectives, including extrinsic factors such as rewards, awards and bonuses, and intrinsic motivations that occur through personal factors, psychological and individual goals. In this context, the gamification emerges as a supportive strategy to achieve this goal. Gamification consists of applying game in the work context to induce and energize worker desired behaviour. Different studies clearly suggest that gamified systems have the motivational potential for workplaces and promote the maximization and effectiveness of their systems. Encouraging further discussion on the benefits and challenges of gamification to develop motivation among workers is essential. In this study we present a bibliometric review aiming at identifying studies on gamification in the workplace and understanding which are the main topics addressed in the literature."

Nevertheless, while the acquisition of specific competences is well assumed by the different subjects of each degree, the same is not true for cross-curricular competences. More specifically, in most engineering studies, these competences are developed indirectly through elective subjects or other complementary training activities. The main objective of this work is to design a prototype of a low-cost and open-access exoskeleton that can be used in different engineering degrees for the acquisition of cross-curricular competences. Once this prototype has been designed, we propose to use it in a practice to be carried out in the laboratory following the project-based learning methodology from a STEAM approach. With the use of a robotics kit and a project-based learning methodology, we achieve the goals of educational robotics and computational thinking in a higher education environment."

This scenario is not foreign to companies dedicated to the development of open-source projects, whose products have experienced a boom over the last decade, leading more and more organizations to include them in their portfolios to improve their IT management, accelerate their digital transformation and boost their businesses. These changes are due to the unique qualities and characteristics of free software, which provide organizations with a wide range of helpful solutions for data analysis, distributed communication, or application deployment. It is essential for these types of companies, which are often supported by communities of developers, to have a culture and values aligned with agility, to prevent the numerous problems that may be caused by the lack of agility concerning the sustainability and transparency of their projects, thereby seriously damaging their competitiveness. This work presents the current state of a doctoral research to support a new open approach that provides solutions and proposals to these organizations and Open-Source communities, providing them with values, principles, guidelines, and agile skills with which to respond to the difficulties and complex dynamics that they face in the agile scaling process."

Hence, we propose the creation of development classrooms or labs in research groups of excellence, which will enhance learning for these groups of students. For this we require the help from the Ministry of Education. Clearly, we must make university teachers aware that these types of students have special educational needs. Further, students with high abilities are not always high-achieving students. Therefore, we must train the university teacher in the detection of these students, and in proper intervention in those cases. Finally, students with high capabilities must be made conscious of their need for a different approach: they should learn to demand their rights, for the good of all."

This work aims to fill this gap in the literature, analyzing the racist and xenophobic hate speech that is spread through YouTube comments in Spanish. Specifically, a manual classification has been carried out to detect hate messages, as well as latent sentiments in comments. On the other hand, a topic modelling was carried out exclusively on hate comments. The results show the characteristics of the racist/xenophobic discourse that spreads through YouTube in Spanish, which, in general terms, represents migration as a burden and a threat, and calls for a government that carries out tougher and more restrictive immigration measures."

Hyperconnectivity, over-information and a whole series of characteristics of our times have a direct influence on the construction of this 'self'. It is for this reason that the field of education needs to address this construction. So far, by viewing information and communication technologies (ICT) as mere means, the dominant pedagogical discourse has concentrated on establishing good practices and limits on their use. This paper, on the other hand, will seek to show that this strategy of pedagogical action is not only insufficient, but also inadequate. To do so, we will first describe the model of 'self' that, through these good practices and imposed limits, we are trying to protect. We will then show the extent to which this type of ‘self’ does not fit in with today's world. We will do this by highlighting the importance of understanding ICT as an end in itself, and not merely as a means. Finally, we will conclude by highlighting the need for an educational approach that is based on this teleological focus on technology."

In this scenario, using portable devices such as tablets and smartphones is the most popular choice. However, the design of mobile game-based learning (mGBL) solutions is challenging, so new approaches are needed for a higher motivation, enjoyment, and immersion of students. A promising approach among them is the use of empathic design thinking. This paper studies the usefulness of empathic design, by applying assessment techniques like context mapping and activity system modeling to understand how empathic design would focus on the usability and effectiveness of mobile game-based learning solutions for lecturers and learners. The context mapping was done by applying a mixed-research approach with a questionnaire and empathy map-based interviews which revealed that lecturers have a high level of openness to be co-designers of mGBL instruments that would motivate learners to develop problem-solving, creative thinking and collaboration skills. The lecturers consider that adoption of empathic design principles for mGBL creation would be efficient, by engaging them in this process as entities that will impact the usefulness and usability of mGBL products. From these results, the Activity System is presented an mGBL modeling complex design approach that would engage lecturers and learners in the innovative mGBL transformation."

This lack of knowledge, added to the social influences that generate pressure on boys and girls, leads to risky behaviour. Objective: This work aims to find out about issues related to sexuality among adolescents that occur in multimedia environments. Also, to complete the study, the aim is to determine what adolescents think about sexuality and sexual health. The research questions are as follows: (1) What do adolescents know about sexual health, (2) Are programmes and interventions being carried out to provide adolescents with information about sexuality, and (3) Is sexuality currently a taboo subject? Method: The study was carried out using qualitative methodology and the phenomenological method, and non-participant observation and semi-structured interviews were used as techniques. Results: As a result, it has been obtained those adolescents consult virtual environments for information; however, not all the information is helpful and adequate. Conclusions: The conclusion is that there is a need to promote intervention programmes and sex education as a normalised subject and eliminate existing taboos."

We also present the results of its use in the classroom and the application of a predictive model of machine learning (neural network) of student failure based on the student's profile. The resulting tool allows teachers to effectively track the entire teaching and learning process and early identify students that are most likely to fail, allowing them to devote more time to those students and try new strategies to improve their programming skills."

In this respect, sexuality has been a repressed area in educational contexts, being today considered a fundamental aspect in the development and process of learning and socializing people. Although the need to improve educational policies in the area has been recognized, to date it is not implemented as a strategic resource in formal education. On the other hand, with the advent of new technologies, we face new ways of communicating and interacting, which interferes in the sexual sphere. Aware that the sexual and technological plane has been intertwined, it is recognized that the lack of a responsible technological culture, coupled with poor sex education, increases the risks in cyberspace. In this context, the motivation of this project is to generate an objective diagnosis of the current state of sexual education in the Chilean context, followed by a proposal for training future teachers that will promote the development of new strategies, thus promoting the role of sexuality in schools. The purpose of this document is to present the research plan for this doctoral thesis and its current status. The context and motivation, a review of the literature and the proposal for a mixed method with a sequential exploratory design are presented. The results are expected to set the guidelines for developing a meaningful educational proposal in teacher training."

Taking this theoretical approach into consideration, the general objective of this study is to analyze how young people use some of the platforms and social media. Through descriptive research, a sample of 2.066 Spanish adolescents from 12 to 18 years who responded to an online questionnaire was analyzed, considering differences in prevalence of use by age and gender. Results highlighted a higher prevalence of use of Instagram, WhatsApp and TikTok, compared to other social networks such as Snapchat or Facebook without differences by age or gender. Some of the conclusions derived from the study indicate that social networks are an indisputable vehicle for young people to communicate, and even more so through the pandemic, and therefore, it is essential to consider whether the digital environment in which they interact is safe. In this line, this study advocates a critical and constructive training that presents young people as the true protagonists of their virtual actions and aware of the risks and advantages that are established in their daily lives."

This paper studies the feasibility of a learning model based on electronic focus (e-focus) groups and participatory design to carry out Project-based Learning (PBL) in these contexts of distance education. E-focus groups are debates supported by telematics tools to interchange ideas about solutions that must satisfy requirements of a real-world problem. Each debate is moderated by the members of a work group who must elicit requirements and build solutions. Stakeholders are classmates who participate in these debates to propose requirements and verify solutions. This model has been applied to teach a Human-Computer Interaction subject of the Computer Science degree of the University of Cantabria. To study the feasibility of this learning model, this paper analyzes the following three aspects: (i) the impact of the e-focus groups’ proposals to improve the problem-solving process, (ii) problems to meet the deadlines of the project schedule and (iii) the students’ satisfaction. The results of this analysis support the feasibility of applying this model to carry out PBL in a distance learning context."

I say there was a failure to understand the role of technology in the growing commodification and managerialism in education. I point to the links between MOOCs, Open Educational Resources and Open Education and PLEs. I point to a contradiction between commodification and managerialism, with increasingly standardized curricula and credentials and the flourishing of opportunities for learning especially for adults. I say progress in researching, developing and implementing PLEs has to be viewed within the context of the wider development of educational technology and of the education and training system as a whole. Indeed, even this may be too narrow a perspective: one ambition for PLEs has been to support learning outside the formal education system and outside the classroom. I look at the growing use of Learning Analytics and Artificial Intelligence in education and consider how this might support PLEs. Finally, I refer to Neil Selwyn's idea of Ed-Tech Within Limits’ which would foreground the need to plan future education technology use with a primary aim of ‘coping with finiteness’” and “seek to re-establish technology use in education as a shared and communal activity” as a response to the climate crisis.

One of them, a standard patient (average hernia size) and the other, with large hernias (loss of domain) and complex treatment. Materials and methods: During the year 2021 two men aged 88 and 67 years with bilateral inguinal hernias without previous abdominal wall or groin surgeries were included in this study. Measurements (volume, surface, diameters) of certain anatomical areas (hernial sacs and rings) were made using preoperative computed tomography and the 3D Slicer® multimedia program, fashioning 3D reconstructions of these structures and its measures. An inguinal hernia score-based chart classification with a therapeutic approach was tailored following the current guidelines and recommendations. Results: These two cases underwent on a quantitative classification based on 5 parameters to be measured (number of organs involved in the hernia sac, number of recurrences, total hernial volume, hernia/abdominal volume rate and hernial ring surface). The first patient which was an usual non complicated case scored 5 on our classification, which means a grade 1, undergoing a laparoscopic technique alone (TAPP). The other patient presented a score according to this chart of 15, which also had a Hernial Vol./Abdominal Vol. rate of almost 25% (23.8), so treatment with botulinum toxin A was developed to increase the elasticity of the abdominal wall and preoperative induced pneumoperitoneum and laparoscopic surgery (TAPP) was performed. Both surgeries were performed fitting the current available scientific literature on this surgical field. Conclusion: The use of 3D technology and the introduction of a classification that allows a quantitative and objective assessment for therapeutic purposes are presented as valuable tools in the prevention of the appearance of hernia recurrences and its complications."

However, it is worth pointing out that the gap is not uniform in all STEM fields. Women’s underrepresentation is more marked in physics, engineering, and computer science fields. Nowadays, the labor market is becoming more competitive, technology-based and demands a diverse workforce. Therefore, it is important to continue promoting the participation of women in STEM, and the universities play a leading role in it. Previous research has shown that early learning experiences in STEM can show female students that they can succeed in this fields. This paper describes a model for developing programming courses for pre-university students to promote the participation of young women in STEM programs. The course was developed in one week, 25 students (16 girls and 9 boys) participated. The instructors of the course were four female professors. The programming language was Python, and the methodology used case-based learning. Both instructors and students gave positive comments on their experience in the course. The proposed model, including instruments, learning resources, and methodology, can be replicated and adapted to be used even in other learning fields."

From the beginning, several international organizations were interested in measuring academic performance with the aim of improving educational policies and practices to increase school effectiveness. One of the organizations that is strongly committed and that has studies for the evaluation of academic performance is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). This program has great international relevance as it establishes the primary objective of studying and evaluating the acquisition of skills in 15-year-old students, a result that is taken into account by the different countries to modify their educational policies. This is the case of Portugal, a country that aims to improve the skills of its students by reforming curriculum policies. Now, a key question in these changes is to check the PISA variables that are directly related to the curriculum to know to what extent these variables can be used to improve school effectiveness, in order to predict the success of the political changes that are implemented in Portugal. For this purpose, a first quantitative study is carried out, which aims to analyze the impact of the variables (students, schools, and curriculum) on the competences presented by students, resulting from there, their relationship with the level of effectiveness of the centers. Therefore, an in-depth study of the factors associated with school effectiveness and its relationship with the organization and educational practices will be carried out."

The modern design, covering almost the entire subject-spatial environment of a human habitat, plays a special role in the process of ensuring sustainable development; namely the formation of its social, cultural, economic and environmental components. At first glance, it seems that the activities of designers are aimed only at creating new products and supporting the economy; in fact, their activities are quite diverse and affect the ecological and social spheres of society. Designers make a serious contribution to sustainable developments’ problems solving, since design products not only functionally provide and organize people's lives, but also affect their physiological and psychological state, because the arrangement of the subject-spatial environment affects the quality of human life, the state of health, psychophysical comfort, etc. The design process must be environmentally and socially responsible, and design thinking must be not only mobile and creative, but also sustainable. Environmental education should be implemented in all spheres of society; first of all, it should become a part of the design education. The article discusses the issues of using digital technologies in the process of professional training of future designers, namely when teaching students to develop projects on various topics related to the development of ecological culture, using technological, constructive and compositional-artistic techniques that ensure the environmental friendliness of the developed subject-spatial environment."

There is an urgency in the literature emerging during the pandemic to develop each student's reading skills since there is no development without literacy. For this reason, research studies report randomized control trials (RCT) for comprehensive reading programs that are of great interest to the educational system. This article aims to analyze the characteristics of these studies and the trends of new contributions to education. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 63 articles published between January 2015 and January 2019 in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. We explored three themes using seven questions. The themes were a) Impact evaluation and randomized control trial (RCT), its approach and criteria; b) innovation and technology in reading programs; and c) the use of technology in the social appropriation of knowledge. The findings showed an increase in randomized control trials in impact evaluation, the need to optimize the quality of these studies, and the challenge of integrating innovation and technology in reading programs. We concluded that increasing and optimizing the impact evaluation approach in these topic research contributes in a substantive way to researchers and government decision making and to advance in the path of achieving a fair, equitable and quality education for all."

However, with the advancement of technology in recent years, a new area of preventative monitoring has been developed, using wearables such as smartwatches within the healthcare field. The objectives of this study are threefold. First, investigate the average use of smartwatches within healthcare, and to which degree it is being used on patients. Second, to explore the differences between the medical use of smartwatches in nursing homes between northern and southern Europe. Third, measure the growth of the use of smartwatches within nursing homes. To do so, a systematic literature review was performed, covering the period from 2010 to 2021. Although, a total of 712 studies were retrieved, 16 were included in this review. The results show an overall positive assessment of the use of smartwatches within nursing homes, both in northern and southern Europe. However, there is a difference in use, based on the assessed needs, such as the difference between climates. The use of smartwatches within nursing homes has great potential, both within northern and southern Europe.

Therefore, many people think that multiculturalism should be the focus of rural socialist core values education. This paper puts forward the research on the education of rural socialist core values under the background of multi culture. Through the investigation and analysis of this paper, we can see that multi culture has the advantages of attaching importance to ceremony and etiquette, model demonstration and so on, and can promote the development of rural social core values education. Based on the current situation of socialist core values education, this paper studies the application of multiculturalism in different regions and the satisfaction of multiculturalism in different groups. Through comparative analysis, it shows that both urban and rural people are more than 80% satisfied with multiculturalism, which provides a guarantee for the education of rural socialist core values."

In this work, we present a collection of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teacher and student in the teaching and initial learning process of programming. Early identification of potential problems and immediate response is a fundamental aspect to avoid student failure and reduce dropout rates. This paper also describes a machine-learning (neural network) predictive model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built throughout programming classes by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities. Finally, we present the results obtained in the use of our set of strategies applied to our study group with particular characteristics in introductory programming course (Introduction to Programming), lectured to the first year, first semester, students of the CS course at the Polytechnic of Guarda (IPG), Portugal."

In this context, the interest is focused on the performance and subsequent reinforcement of the communicative competence in professors regarding the sudden change that occurred in 2020 and its future perspectives. To approach this issue, we will start from the study of the perception of teachers from various Chilean higher education institutions regarding the conceptualization and application of this competence and the structural and personal factors that have influenced it in this period, gathering information through a semi-structured interview. A survey will be created and applied to a representative sample of the Faculties and areas of knowledge investigated from the interaction between the professors' report and the elements already present within the study of communicative competence in the Digital Competency Frameworks in the first part. Finally, from the information extracted from the aforementioned tools, a plan will be elaborated to develop communicational skills to complement teaching in virtual environments."

A content analysis of the posts in a discussion forum about experiences with video creation reveals that though most of the teachers think that their students value positively the use of this kind of educational resources, the great amount of time required to create them does not encourage their use. Besides, they are rather critical of aesthetic aspect of the final products, and reluctant to appear in the audiovisual materials. These opinions are influenced by the urgent adaptation to online learning due to covid-19 pandemic that forced many teachers to record educational videos for the first time in a stressful context."

In education, the gender gap is not only visible in the number of women who enroll in engineering programs, but also in the percentage of women who finish those studies and finally join the labor market in a job in the engineering sector. Regarding the professional context, the gender gap impacts the solutions and products developed in the different engineering areas. Teams that do not take into account diversity cannot cover the needs of a diverse society. The challenge is not reduced to increase the number of women in engineering areas, but also empower them to solve other gender issues such as the glass ceiling, pay gap or unbalanced sharing of caring responsibilities. For this reason, although we should continue working on increasing the number of women who study engineering, we have also to teach gender equality values to the engineering students as a way to face the inequalities that arise in the labor market. In this context, gender mainstreaming in engineering degrees can have a significant impact. It is important to teach professors to introduce the gender perspective in their lessons. However, a first step is needed to know their opinions and ideas about gender equality in engineering. This work presents the results of a pilot study with engineering educators from different Europe, Middle East, and Africa institutions, which participate in the International Conference EDUCON 2021."

People need to continuously learn new knowledge, acquire new skills, and adapt to new situations. PLEs could support this continuous learning necessity. However, the learner should have specific digital skills for PLE development and management. This paper addresses these needed digital skills. Initially, the paper introduces a PLE model to present how the learner uses applications to access and manage resources in order to develop his/her PLE. Then, it describes the stages that the learner follows in order to collect, manage, develop, and share resources as well as communicate and collaborate with others in his/her PLE. Finally, the paper presents the digital skills needed by the learner in order to develop and manage a PLE."

For this reason, it is necessary to design formal and informal educational policies for digital literacy. High-level literacy skills must be developed to form conscious, critical, and active viewers, capable of programming their own media consumption and making efficient use of information. Media literacy can create critical consumers. If consumers learn the codes and languages of the media, analyze their contents and values, know their effects and influences, etc., they can learn to ""read"" information. The transformation of the media in recent years and the development of new channels of communication and information, such as social networks, make it necessary to promote the development of media literacy among students in all areas of knowledge. This article presents some proposals for working on media literacy at the University through collaborative and interdisciplinary work."

Digitality gives young people access to new social spaces, changing their patterns of communication and relate to each other. In this sense, the development of youth identities involves a technological education, over and above the new familiar mechanisms of digital literacy that have turned out to be insufficient. For this reason, this year we are looking for theoretical and empirical support that allows us to understand how we use digital devices to generate pedagogical practices and resources for young people. Also, in the last session of this track, we conclude that this phenomenon not only affects young people. That is why in this edition our objective has been to explore not only how technology affects the lives of young people, but also that of other groups such as the elderly."

However, in order to effectively use EAI to help in the diagnose and treat health conditions there are still significant challenges to be tackled. Because EAI is still under development, one of the most important challenges is to integrate the technology into the health provision process. In this sense, it is important to complement EAI technologies with expert supervision, and to provide health professionals with the necessary tools to make the best of EAI without a deep knowledge of the technology. The present work aims to provide an initial architecture proposal for making use of different available technologies for emotion recognition, where their combination could enhance emotion detection. The proposed architecture is based on an evolutionary approach so to be integrated in digital health ecosystems, so new modules can be easily integrated. In addition, internal data exchange utilizes Robot Operating System (ROS) syntax, so it can also be suitable for physical agents."

Because educational innovation is implemented on a local level, the target audience is the pupils of a topic. In other industries, innovation is highly transferrable since it is produced for a broad segment of the target population. This study hypothesizes that educational innovation can be designed on a worldwide scale for a broad segment of the target population. The case study is placed in the context of innovations aimed at increasing student participation in the classroom. To that goal, teachers from several educational sectors (kindergarten, primary, secondary, vocational training, and university) were handed a questionnaire asking them to rate the qualities of passive pupils (according to their own experience). If there is a coincidence, it will be demonstrated that the target audience is global and that its qualities would be the same in different educational contexts.

The research approach consists of a case study in which the following 21st-century competencies were analyzed as categories: creativity, innovation, initiative, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Semi-structured interviews and participant observation in a focus group were used as instruments to collect information. In this group of teachers, it was found that the collaborative strategies fostered teamwork and self-reflection and the interest in developing these skills to collaborate with the development of students towards new needs. It is considered that integrating entrepreneurship training strategies helps teachers to build the necessary competencies for the requirements of society. Still, higher education institutions must maintain this teacher training process to incorporate them into their daily practice."

For this reason, there is a motivation to develop this skill in network learning program projects. However, there are limitations to its development since the design of online courses has several characteristics inherited from traditional education. This phenomenon is repeated in the Virtual Learning Environment of Redu, an experience developed in the Federal University of Pernambuco institutional setting. This study aimed to identify and evaluate aspects of Redu's functionalities to propose developing educational strategies that promote critical thinking. Through the triangulation method, data of diverse nature were analyzed to verify how asynchronous interactions between teachers and students eventually supported the structuring of situations to promote the development of critical thinking and identify the platform's limitations to support the progress of this skill. The results emphasized that there is a divorce between the concept of Virtual Learning Environments and the methodologies used by teachers to encourage the development of critical thinking that leads to the neglect of several of the characteristics of the students. Finally, the attributes of Redu are listed that, from our point of view, will allow the environment to become a support with the possibility of amplifying the technology to develop critical thinking."

But DDA can also be used to improve and render more effective the training of e-sports players by creating even more challenging environments that always push the gamer to his/her limits. This article presents a first step towards that objective: in this study, the First-Person Shooter (FPS) game Half-Life was modified to allow several game mechanics (and, accordingly, the game's difficulty) to be adjusted in real-time creating what was expected to be an improved and more immersive experience to the player. The DDA algorithm makes these adjustments according to the previous actions of the player and towards a predefined performance goal. Preliminary results with a group of e-sports players showed positive results in terms of their perceived experience."

This work focuses on designing an educational tool suitable to help students learn and practice transformations in the specific context of an undergraduate computer graphics course. Even when the subject of study is the same, the learning objectives are different in other educational contexts, such as elementary or middle education. We propose in this work a cards-based video game founded in a model that constrains the input variables of learning exercises without sacrificing the diversity of scenarios and difficulty levels. Incorporating this model into a video game is congruent because it privileges the visual over the numerical information that defines a specific ""before and after"" style of learning exercise. The game mechanics were designed around a set of requirements thought to meet the student's needs, such as learning by experimenting, instant feedback, and matrix representation, among other criteria. The video game was developed in the Unity engine, and it is ready to be tested in the classroom during the next phase of our research. We expect to gather qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate its potential as a learning tool for undergraduate students coursing computer graphics."

Cultural policy experiments are time-consuming, too costly, and risky. Thus, there is a clear need to have feasible simulation models, which could help to foresee some consequences of social and cultural policies. However, there is a lack of available metrics, conceptual approaches, not to mention simulation models. In this paper, we present a scaled-down simulation of stylized cultural events' impact on social capital dynamics using NetLogo agent-based simulation model. The presented abstract model of social capital dynamics is based on well-known principles of Axelrod's model for culture dissemination, which we expanded for the agents' interaction not only in the physical space but also in the cultural features' space as well. Due to the added extensions, the presented simulation model is capable of simulating the impact of broadcasted cultural events. It is aimed to model not only neighborhood (pair-to-pair) interactions between simulated agents but also larger-scale social networking and mass media impact. Simulation results, among other things, reveal a plausible mechanism of culture impact to social capital, and cultural conditions for the emergence of various social cohesion states like globalization, polarization, or radicalization."

This model is called Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), which seeks to create the foundations to achieve sustainable development. In Higher Education, there are some examples of the transition process from EE to ESD, especially in Europe, but in some places from Latin America, until now the ESD model is being explored in universities and its acceptance is reviewed. This is further enhanced in engineering programs where ESD is still not very visible. This research presents an analysis of the transition from EE to ESD in an Environmental Engineering program at Santo Tomas University in Colombia, Latin America. A survey was conducted to three groups of students, two groups formed under the EE model, and another group for which an ESD course was created. From the survey and a curricular analysis, it was possible to identify the inclusion status and the student's acceptance of this undergraduate program for the ESD model. As a global result, it is identified that the curriculum is still anchored to EE, but students find the ESD model more attractive and up-to-dated."

Strategies for creation and design,"Reuter, Jessica and Ferreira Dias, Marta and Amorim, Marlene and Figueiredo, Claudia and Veloso, Claudia and Figueiredo, Claudia",10.1145/3434780.3436664,https://doi.org/10.1145/3434780.3436664,Association for Computing Machinery,Eighth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"Educational Escape rooms are games designed for teaching consisting on challenges played in groups where the participants are asked to solve a series of clues and puzzles in a limited amount of time to ""escape the room"". In recent years Escape rooms have attracted the interest of educators and institutions for their ability to foster the development of valuable skills, considered critical for the job market such as teamwork, leadership, creative thinking, communication and a variety of soft skills necessary for professional success. In teaching, the design of Escape rooms is still in its embryonic stage, but new studies are emerging. As several authors report the learning is absorbed more effectively by students with active participation, practices and discussions on content [21],[4]. These skills are extensively developed in the application of the Escape rooms which are planned and designed specifically for each content, according to the need and learning objectives. The design and development of these Escape rooms is a crucial phase of the process and a challenge for many educators who wish to apply these activities in the classroom. In order to offer a timely contribution to this body of knowledge, this article synthesises the creation and design of Escape rooms in an educational environment, based on existing literature. To this end, the study builds on selected examples of success and some references and tools for creating Escape rooms."

The risks associated with the use of technology and the Internet and the development of critical thinking in hyperconnected actions are considered, among with descriptions of the parental control patterns used by the families. A qualitative study has been carried, working through methodologies of discussion groups and in-depth interviews. The results show that families consider social networks and video games as the principal acting scenarios in minors. Also, they perceive the addiction to new technologies, loss of values or bullying as the mayor risks perceived on the net. Accordingly, families adopt parental control measures like punishments or removal of technological devices, as well as time management and connection schedules. Similarly, they highlight their concern in considering it necessary to develop their children's critical thinking in the face of hyperconnectivity."

This deformity affects the self-esteem of the person and isolates them from society. Therefore, this work seeks to raise that self-esteem and improve the quality of life of the people who own it; providing them with an affordable prosthesis option, thanks to the three-dimensional design and the selection of suitable materials in the realization of an auricular prosthesis. The techniques used until now for this type of prosthesis are the reconstruction by autogenous tissues and the manual modeling of the prosthesis, for a posterior fixation through titanium implants. These two options require several surgeries and long recovery times.For this reason, in this work new design and manufacturing technologies are used, at the service of medicine. Including three-dimensional scanning, 3D design and modeling in CAD programs, finite element analysis, selection and optimization of biocompatible materials and rapid manufacturing through prototyping. All this together will help improve medical procedures and patients will be able to visualize their 3D prosthesis before implantation. In addition, that will mean a reduction in waiting times and in the manufacturing costs of this type of prosthesis."

At such young ages, education is essential. Also, in these ages, videogames are an interactive tool with a massive use that can provide benefits beyond entertainment. We consider that videogames can be effectively used for improving gender equality education. In this paper, we conduct a review of the videogames used with goals related to education on equality and raising awareness about inequality or gender violence aspects, and the limitations encountered on such works. To start covering the limitations found, we present two initiatives developed to foster education on equality and that can be used as a guideline for future research on this area."

However, unfortunately, the reality is that many employees do not know how the institute works and see everything as complex and unnecessary bureaucracy that leads to more work and delays due to petitions with problems, such as being unclear, or it is missing information. We conducted a survey to identify how employees of IFPB react when they need to make a petition and to measure the current state of Knowledge Management (KM) practices in this unit. Our results suggest that most of employees do not know how every type of petition works, they prefer to use the Village Paradigm to find information, and they believe that IFPB does not promotes KM practices."

Its main objective is to analyze young people's perceptions, opinions, and motivations regarding their use of technology and habits. To do so, a qualitative study was performed using discussion groups with 130 participants organized in groups of respondents aged 12 to 16 and 16 to 18 from Castilla y Le\'{o}n (Spain). Analysis was then performed using the NVivo software program. The results showed that there is a difference in use and tools between the age groups. However, both sets of groups use their free time to seek to communicate with their peer group and share personal information but also to find information, which they say they cannot find in other spaces, such as school or their families. In addition, they also say that using technology, social networks, and mobile apps allows them to disconnect. Young people claim to lose the concept of time, in particular the older ones. Younger respondents report having less availability of screens and more parental controls, while in contrast older one's state that they use the time management strategy less as self- regulation. The results found warrant focusing the pedagogical discourse on designing and promoting quality education to find solutions to this new technological paradigm that involves young people. They were born with digitality incorporated, but it is necessary to incorporate education not only from a basic conception of educational research, but from approaches that result in guidelines for political and educational action. Working to establish healthy personal relationships, as well as developing social and communication skills, are key aspects to go beyond the concept of technology as mere entertainment."

Firstly, those changes have implied moving from traditional class sessions to class sessions in form of ‘pills’, defined as brief and concise contributions of knowledge which highlight some elements of a specific topic. In fact, ‘pills’ are designed to stimulate both student-student interaction as well professor-student interaction, within the framework of a Project Based Learning methodology. Secondly, as part of the subject redesign, self-evaluation and peer to peer evaluation will be introduced the next academic year, with the goal of improving the assessment of competences. In order to do that it, these evaluating activities have been introduced this academic year to check the viability of those tools, although without having a real weight in the final grade of the students. The results obtained shed light on the issue and have helped to identify some possible adjustments in order to effectively implement self and peer assessment in the future courses."

In order to compile projects of interest, we have the Erasmus+ Project Results Platform, which has a very useful information database to locate educational projects that have been funded by the European Union. This database compiles European educational projects that have been developed in Erasmus+ and also in previous programs such as Lifelong Learning Programme since 2007. The advantage of using this tool is that it has a search engine that allows you to search by keywords and has different criteria to filter. It also allows you to export up to a maximum of 1000 projects per search in excel format with basic data from the filtered projects. Therefore, using this tool is key to be able to identify good practices in European educational projects that serve as a reference to find the parameters useful for learning improvement. This article presents the main data collected from the analysis of educational projects that are connected with eLearning and related methodologies in the aforementioned platform. It also defines which ones will be selected to be able to address an adequate analysis that is manageable to carry out the definition of a methodological guide. As a result of the initial analysis, it is considered appropriate to carry out a review of the projects linked to eLearning in KA1 and KA2 actions that have more than 50 projects connected to this topic, involving educational centers, and that are labelled as good practice and / or success story. With the projects that meet these criteria, there is enough information to achieve the objectives of the research in order to be able to design a methodological guide with the key aspects for implementing eLearning projects."

We live in an increasingly digital society that requires citizens to be prepared to adapt to the needs of the moment and to solve the problems that arise. For this to be possible, the education system must be prepared to adequately train future citizens who will join a changing labor market. To this end, teachers must be trained and know how to carry out efficient educational projects that allow them to make the most of the potential of ICT in the classroom or in distance education. The situation experienced during the 2019-2020 school year with the COVID-19 pandemic has tested the education system and its ability to adapt to a situation where the use of distance education was required and where ICT was very much needed in most of the cases to bring education to the homes. These factors make it very necessary to work for a better teaching professionalization. Therefore, the main objective of this PhD work is to enable teachers to design their projects, involving electronic learning, in a more effective way. To achieve this, what better than to use the educational projects compiled in the Erasmus+ results platform, which allow the analysis of project typology, outcomes, topics and to see those that have been catalogued as a good practice or success story. This database will be a key tool to gather information together with the collaboration of the main actors of those projects that have been successful. A methodological guide would allow teachers and teacher trainers to know the key factors that help to achieve a good design of educational projects and allow an optimal use of ICT resources and the greatest impact on the teaching-learning process."

The social impact of universities can be reflected back on the relations they have with governments, non-profit organizations, communities, industry, and in environmental initiatives. Most of universities’ interaction with the actors aforementioned are through service-learning, community-oriented projects, technology transfer, incubators, governments and non-profit organizations, amongst others which, through knowledge, benefit not only the students, but directly impact the actors as well. USR reports tend to concentrate on planned and directed actions to fill in reports, however the dynamics of the university lead to SAK spill over on other actors, and it must be seen as a fundamental part of USR. This research proposes a technology-based platform generated by a mixed methods and concurrent triangulation research developed in two phases. The first phase, QUAN-qual, will allow a base design which captures the dynamics of SAK in the context of USR, while the second phase, quan-QUAL, concentrates in the validation of the proposed prototype. The project aims to answer how different levels of information exchange, negotiation, and knowledge transfer occur in the SAK development of a dynamic Social Responsibility in university environments mediated by a technology-based platform."

This reduced participation of women, very low in disciplines related with technology motivates the hegemonic presence of androcentric and sexist values both in knowledge and in the products and information technologies that we can find in the market.In highly masculinized disciplines the inclusion of the gender perspective is important whenever the content, the results or the applications of a subject may affect human beings directly or indirectly. Specially, in disciplines related with technology where it is very common for men and women to be affected differently by technological developments. This paper focus in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, where the majority of professionals are men and their experiences shape and dominate algorithm creation. To recognize the existence of gender discriminatory biases in the algorithms and limit their consequences in the offline world, we need to introduce the gender perspective in these studies. In this document we analyze the degree of introduction of the gender perspective in the AI grades and how to improve the gender competences of the students"

In order to reduce this gap, higher education institutions have a key role in the implementation of the attraction process for young girls and guidance into STEM programs. In this regard, the CUCEI, which is the disciplinary center from the Universidad de Guadalajara that holds the majority of STEM educational careers, has been focused on implementing strategies of attraction and diffusion in order to increase the number of women that choose to study a STEM-related degree program. For the achievement of this purpose CUCEI included in their “Development Plan 2014 – 2022” activities directed to develop and reinforce the scientific vocations in basic and higher education. This work focuses on the description of the three of the major programs implemented in CUCEI for the promotion of science and gender equality in education, “Science for girls and boys”, “Technovation Girls” and “W-STEM” and the analysis of the enrollment changes in STEM programs from 2009 to 2019. The implementation of these programs has had good acceptance by the young girls. An indirect way of correlation is to determine the enrollment statistics of women on STEM careers in CUCEI, where we can observe three main behaviors: careers that had a gradual or low increase until 2013 and from there have shown a high increase of the female enrollment, careers that have been showing a decreasing in the number of women since 2009, and careers that show a balanced proportion of woman and man enrollment. We consider that the dissemination of STEM careers through programs such as Technovation Girls, W-STEM, and Science for girls and boys, have had some impact in girls, considering the general increase of women in CUCEI's careers and the sharing experiences with some of the girls, involved in the programs, with which we have maintained contact."

The interaction with these technologies not only provides the immediate supply of any virtual content but increases the possibilities of personalization through artificial intelligence (AI). AI in all of its developments, is advancing faster than the capacity of institutions and organizations to provide legal and deontological responses. Finding solutions to its implications in new ecosystems where technology learns from human routines and interacts with users is a challenge that must be addressed from the academic, political and business fields. Technology advances show that algorithms and automatization have become omnipresent in contemporary times, increasingly determining the nature of the contents that reach the users. This work offers an interpretative descriptive framework based on two main objectives: firstly, describing the evolution of voice assistants as tools for the automated personalization of information contents —about which each individual becomes aware of his environment and makes decisions; and secondly, highlighting the ethical demands on AI when personalizing contents in voice interfaces. In result the study presented offers an open debate to the increasing concern that algorithms can actually influence people, replicating or amplifying existing biases, bringing a wide and current field for academics to explore."

There exists a clear relevance in the analysis of ICT in the audience-visitor's behavior habits, their actions, opinions and evaluations. We live in a digitized society where these technologies are the prime medium and channel for our interactions, this process also takes place at museums. In this context, the Internet and digital applications are the key for museums to properly implement their communication and their relationship with the public; and therefore, it is essential to understand the impact that these tools have on visitors and their interaction.We have been able to provide a series of key conclusions in this 3.0 communication scenario where the museum audience is. Along our research we observe and detect how the use of social networks, the website and virtual reality has to be consistent with the museum's function as an educational and communicative space. The website is a key piece both for generic information and for building an interactive educational guide aimed at all types of audiences, children, young people or adults, through the inclusion of multiple tools provided by the hypermedia environment.The public of the museums of Castille and Le\'{o}n considers the informative task of the museums as a determining factor, but according to the results, little interest is detected in the informative resources aimed at the age group under 24 years. The younger audience is less satisfied and cared for in their audiovisual demands and needs. Therefore, from the museum perspective it is necessary to bet on an inclusive digital educative and communicative perspective that increases the impact on the audience and allows a more participatory dialogue with the public of the museums in our cultural environment.For this reason, from the museum cultural sector it is necessary to bet on an inclusive digital and communication strategy that increases the impact on the audience and allows a more participatory dialogue with the museum public. Museums must bet on attracting and retaining new audiences including cultural instruments so deeply rooted in the cultural practices of their visitors, their smartphones and social networks.The data obtained in this research (see Table 1) take as a reference the opinions of a sample of 619 people, the majority being women with an age range between 15 to 44 years, of Spanish nationality, residing in a province of the Autonomous Community of Castille and Le\'{o}n and with higher education."

There is ample evidence that supports the benefits of using games for learning and assessment. However, we do not usually find games incorporated into educational environments. One of the main problems that teachers face is to actually know how students are interacting with the game as they cannot analyze properly the effect of the activity on the students. To improve this issue, we can use the data generated by the interaction of students with such educational games to analyze the sequences and errors by transforming raw data into meaningful sequences that are interpretable and actionable for teachers. In this study we use a data collection from our game Shadowspect and implement learning analytics with process and sequence mining techniques to generate two metrics that aim to help teachers make proper assessment and better understand the process."

This is further emphasized with the use of immersive technologies and becomes especially relevant when the experience itself is very difficult to replicate, when not impossible, in the real world. On that regard, this paper analyzes the impact of virtual reality (VR) commercial video games on the existential concern of one's own death. Participants (N 30) played one of three games for 15 minutes and the aftermath was examined using questionnaires and the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP). Our results show that there is no difference in the game experience, despite the different gameplay. However, IRAP results seem to indicate that players of the action game have a different attitude towards death."

Cavitation is a dangerous phenomenon that occurs in pressurized fluid when they rapidly change of pressure in a liquid and a small vapor-filled cavity is generated in regions where the pressure is low. These cavities (or bubbles) are highly damaging to machines and fluid systems. Due to its dangerousness, it is necessary for the engineer to know the consequences of the cavitation and the factors involved in the phenomenon, in order to design solutions that avoid or minimize the damage caused. The design process of the activity starts with a critical analysis to cover the requirements that allow the activity to be carried out in the simplest way possible, using a model and a simplified computational pipeline that allows maximum adaptation to the real phenomenon without the need for laboratory equipment so that it can be integrated into subjects in the field of fluid-mechanics and maintenance engineering."

The project presented consists of developing the design phase of a mobile application called e-mentoring, that facilitates communication, matching and implementation of a mentoring process for university students. To this end, the specific steps to achieve the overall objective are: 1) to perform a diagnosis to identify the applications designed to communicate between mentors and mentees in universities, 2) to identify the requirements for the design of mobile applications and 3) to propose a design model for the application that provides information about the requirements for the design of the mobile application. In this context, the social, graphic design, heuristic evaluation, technological requirements and legal external factors that can influence the development of the mobile application are analyzed. The development of the design for this application is presented as a tool that serves as a meeting point, information and exchange of experiences between students and mentors, and at the same time strengthens and extends the links with the academic processes of their institutions. It also describes the process of model-based design development of the application in question. Considering that the functionalities defined for the mobile application are used through additional development, it is recommended that this is done on the student management system of the university where it is applied. The application resulting from this project is a prototype that will have to be debugged and tested in subsequent phases that are beyond the scope of this project."

Either because of natural disasters or human-made catastrophes, we learn to live with this type of events, unfortunately. In this context, Education usually takes a toll. Learners, teachers, university professors, parents and academic managers need to get up-to-speed in order to adapt their regular flow and methodology to a different mindset and to an adapted skillset. They migrate or re-enforce the ability to teach, learn and manage into an online or blended setting. Open Education, Open Science and Open Innovation become now a useful, if not the most powerful, approach to overcome the obstacle of unexpected and unwanted scenarios. Thanks to an open approach every member of the educational community can use, create, edit and share content, policies, access, technology and long list of benefits, including large amounts of data. This paper provides a few clues towards a seamlessly integration of formal and informal online contexts, blended into the open."

For this reason, the faculty had to change the training to a completely online model, in a very short period of time and without the possibility of planning the process of change. The COVID-19 remains in our lives and continues to affect the training model. Currently, there are teachers using online training, face-to-face classes and there are even dual models where the faculty teaches both presence-based and online classes at the same time. For this reason, there is a need for training methods capable of adapting to different situations. In this work the Flipped Classroom model (a method used in face-to-face classes to make students more active) has been adapted to a hybrid model which can be implemented in any situation at any time. The model was applied during confinement in programming laboratories and the impact of this model has been measured through the works generated by students during the continuous evaluation. The result has been highly positive because the number of works presented by students the generated academic doubts have increased, as well as the average grades obtained during the continuous evaluation."

As technology has become established in our society, having a private mobile device with an Internet connection has become standard. This reality has led to an increase in the time of exposure to the Internet access device and thus increased the potential for addiction. The time variable is considered a trigger for addiction and is present in most of the measurement scales. If we add to this reality the social confinement and distance established in our society due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have the largest increase in time of access to Internet known in history. There are different risk factors for developing an Internet addiction and time is a variable commonly associated with it. Thus, in an era in which reality has changed the time of access to the Internet by the Covid-19 to meet the educational and social demand of adolescents, is there an effective scale to measure addiction that fits the new normality of education in times of Covid-19? This article seeks to answer this question by reviewing the most important scales of Internet addiction in the scientific literature and reflecting on the meaning and use of the time variable as a factor in measuring Internet addiction."

COVID-19 meant a challenge for these Health systems, as in the more severe moments of the pandemic a number of situations arose in which there were not enough neither beds, nor staff, to provide a proper care to all the patients that required it. In these situations, it is essential to perform a meticulous and appropriate screening process, as from it depends that the most vulnerable patients showing a better healing probability will be selected, thus avoiding damages that could cost them their life. In these circumstances, it becomes essential to have tools and protocols available to facilitate the triage process that is, in essence, a decision-making problem aimed to establish a hierarchization of cases.In this work a multi-criteria method is conceptually proposed, based on vague numbers that, taking into account the opinions and considerations of multiple experts, allows to establish a hierarchy that establishes priorities towards Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Because the method is still under development, it hasn't been possible yet to carry out tests intensively, but it is expected that its usage could help the professionals to make decisions in a faster and safer way, improving the process quality and aiming to avoid potential mistakes."

Reflective blogging can be an invaluable tool for peer learning and professional development, particularly in appreciative environments where people feel safe to share their experiences. The proposed model introduces Systems Thinking as an effective way to facilitate group reflective practice for social-emotional learning and resilience building in a blended learning environment. Participants practice how to acknowledge different perspectives and how to integrate them into a coherent group narrative, the collective story of their community. Systems thinking entails a shift of focus from the parts to the relationships between and treats any group of participants as a living network, a learning rhizome in the becoming. In this view, collective intelligence rises as an emergent system property. We provide the case of a recent implementation of the proposed model to reflect and elaborate further on practical aspects of the approach, such as how to cultivate reflective writing among the participants, how to synthesize a group meta-narrative, how to evaluate individual contributions, and how to nurture a learning organization. The aim is to present a concise and authentic account of this approach so as to enable other educators and practitioners to get inspiration, make necessary adaptations, and utilize it in their own practice."

Many times, knowledge is thought of as tactile (knowledge possessed by one individual), which is why explicit knowledge (shared or socialized knowledge) is overlooked. Given the previous, we utilized a collective of creativity to establish a hypothesis for the Knowledge Management project. We considered a spiral model of knowledge known as SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization).

In Brazil, the suspension occurred at the beginning of the educational year, that start in March. This situation lasts for the entire first semester, leading institutions to move to online classes and changing the educational calendar for the next years. The reality of online classes leads to a discussion of a new pedagogical work, where the students and educators should understand how to deal with online learning and take most of the online tools. To achieve this is necessary to understand how students felt during the suspension of presential classes, the resources, and motivation that they have to continue to study. This work proposes a survey that measures three different components that can affect students in return of the online classes: resources that they have to study, feelings experienced during the suspension of the classes, and if they live in the city where they study. This survey was applied to an educational campus that attracts many students from other cities due to the quality of the education provided."

It involves energy and financial knowledge, citizen's attitudes and intentions, and citizen's habits and behavior related to energy. Thus, the assessment of energy literacy levels gives us a general view of citizen's knowledge, concerns, and habits in the energy context. Many factors may influence these levels, nevertheless, in this paper, we will concentrate our research on age to find some patterns. The influence of age on energy literacy has been studied before, however, the difference found in the factors that influence energy literacy by age group was not studied before, at the top of our knowledge. Our paper aims to fill this gap. We also investigate the relationship between attitude, behavior, and knowledge, within defined age groups. The results show that seniors perform better than the other age groups in energy literacy and all of its dimensions, except on behavior. The results also highlight the importance of financial knowledge and energy awareness to determine energy knowledge and energy literacy, and a strong dual relationship between attitude and behavior."

Despite the importance of teamwork within agile development teams, little is known about how teamwork affects agile teams within the higher education environment. This research studied the case of honors students in Information Systems from the University of Cape Town by testing the relationship between teamwork, team members' success, and team performance. Simple linear regression analysis was followed to determine teamwork's influence on team members' success and team performance. The results show that teamwork possesses a strong positive relationship with team members' success and a medium positive relationship with team performance. These findings confirm the vital role of teamwork in agile teams to achieve successful team performance and team members' success. This research contributes to the body of knowledge regarding the influence of teamwork in agile software methods in the higher education environment. Understanding such a relationship will help students recognize the importance of teamwork in delivering a good product that will benefit their grades. Moreover, it would contribute to a better design of curriculums for the Information Systems discipline."

Scientific practices based on OS are increasingly determined by laws and decrees that regulate a research culture, which results in the need for institutional technological ecosystems that should be interoperable and respond to the guidelines derived from the OS movement. A lot of research institutions in the world already have regulations on these practices, while others are developing or seeking consensus. In this work we present a doctoral research plan, focused on studying the culture of open science research and open practices in a Mexican university, so that, derived from the information obtained offer a proposal of a technological ecosystem to contribute to the research exercise of the institution, facing the 0S scheme. The objective is to offer the researchers of the institution the necessary elements to do their work under the OS context, by offering an ecosystem that allows the social appropriation of Science and Technology in the region. The advances in research to date allow us to recognize the taxonomic elements of OS and the theoretical origins of this proposal. The methodological approach is mixed and integral for the analysis of qualitative and quantitative elements of the study universe."

When measuring complex cognitive constructs, it is crucial to correctly design the evaluation items to trigger the intended knowledge and skills. Furthermore, to assess the validity of a test requires considering not only the content of the evaluation tasks involved in the test, but also whether examinees respond to the tasks by engaging construct-relevant response processes. The eye tracking observations helped to fill an ‘explanatory gap’ by providing data on variation in item response processes that are not captured by other sources of process data such as think aloud protocols or computer-generated log files. We proposed a set of metrics that could help test designers to validate the different item formats used in the evaluation of digital competence. The gaze data provided detailed information on test item response strategies, enabling profiling of examinee engagement and response processes associated with successful performance. There were notable differences between the participants who correctly solved the tasks and those who failed, in terms of the time spent on solving them, as well as the data on their gazes. Moreover, this included insights into response processes which contributed to the validation of the assessment criteria of each item."

The main objective is to detect what is the discourse of young women regarding social networks and analyze how they transfer their position towards feminism into their Instagram profiles. To do this, we analyze the discourses of young women participating in two cultural youth groups without a strictly feminist agenda. These are: a group of castellers from a Catalan university and a youth orchestra from Barcelona. To respond to the stated objective, we have carried out eight semi-structured interviews and four life histories with these young participants. The results show that social networks and, specifically, Instagram make the daily practice of feminism more complex and contradictory, consequently it generates a more critical discourse regarding the use of social networks by young women who have an active profile."

For different reasons (age, risk complications, immunologic system) some patients discard the breast reconstruction. Within this group, 90% will use external breast prosthesis to improve their body image and hide the pathology. The existing prosthesis available have different shapes, sizes and are made by different materials (most frequently made by silicon recovered of polyurethane) to maintain a symmetrical shape of the body.However, some studies have revealed that this prosthesis is susceptible to improvement in terms of weight, esthetic result, and costs. That is the reason why this preliminary work aims to obtain an external breast prosthesis model, softer, more flexible, and with the real areola/nipple form to have a more realistic result made by Advance Manufacture (3D printing). Moreover, this prostheses could be customized by scanning the breast gland before the surgery, or the healthy contralateral breast at any time."

The change implies moving from methodology based on traditional magistral classes to a methodology based on Project Based Learning and non-traditional class sessions. Besides, the evaluation of the students will be done by means of three types of assessment, performed by two kinds of actors: professors and students (the last ones, by means of Self-Assessment and Peer to Peer Assessment). Once the Project Based Learning methodology has been implemented, it seems wise to find out the students’ perception of the subject. To do that, a questionnaire to assess motivation, based on MSLQ, was performed (on completion of the course), as well as a satisfaction survey (completed when students had attended half of the total class sessions). Results seem to confirm that the redesign has been effective, although some issues that should be adjusted in the next future were identified."

The interest in developing a design toolkit comes from the lack of tools that help design gamified technologies and experiences with an inclusive approach. There is a growing trend of inclusion at different levels and the exploration of new ways of digital entertainment for those who have not been considered until now, such as seniors. Using tools such as this proposal, the products and services generated may have a greater scope by developing new forms of interaction for people with cultural differences or physical characteristics. For their part, designers will consider a broader target population, and it would save time and/or costs by having this design support guide."

Following the 2018 Cambridge Analytica controversy, most social media providers locked access to their users’ data, leaving researchers with limited options to study the information in it. Scholars have taken different stands, advocating data policies that allow for critical research, achieving partnerships with data providers, or—sometimes—violating the Terms of Use of the platforms to access the information. Despite the limitations, great progress has been made using text-based data, while image-based methodologies remain limited, partly because of the lockout. This paper proposes a methodology for automated image extraction from Instagram, using Instalooter. It presents the necessary setup and steps to obtain images based on a series of search parameters before discussing the ethical implications of its potential use."

One such effective tool in attitudinal learning is Digital game-based learning (DGBL). DGBL environments provide cognitive knowledge and emotionally engage learners by enabling them to test new behaviors and learn from the immediate consequences they see. This paper explains the insights gathered while conducting three research studies that used DGBL in ESE. All studies found that DGBL was effective in attitudinal learning."

The complexity of training for healthcare professionals is intensified by introducing virtual and/or blended training, increased by the influence that the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic is having. In general, the training of healthcare professionals is usually supported by companies or organisations, which either create and develop the courses on an ad hoc basis (a specific course) or more broadly (supporting an annual plan). Bearing in mind that it is the health professionals who act as teachers and the intensification of virtual environments, it is reasonable to consider, as a first step, whether they have the digital teaching skills as to face the realisation (with all that it implies) of activities through virtual training to propose. In a second step, a training model that trains the health professional as a competent digital teacher. These two approaches are part of the objectives of the doctoral thesis ""Incorporation of learning ecosystems by and for health professionals in the hospital environment""."
2021,Seven principles to foster privacy and security in educational tools: Local Educational Data Analytics,"Amo, Daniel and Torres, Ricardo and Canaleta, Xavier and Herrero-Mart\'{\i}n, Javier and Rodr\'{\i}guez-Merino, Cristina and Fonseca, David",10.1145/3434780.3436637,https://doi.org/10.1145/3434780.3436637,Association for Computing Machinery,Eighth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"The New Learning Context (NCA for its initials in Spanish, Nuevo Contexto de Aprendizaje) is the new pedagogical framework that is being designed and implemented at the La Salle Institutions since 2017. The main objective is to deploy the pedagogical design across all educational centers and stages. In the context of NCA, digital technology is another pillar in the educational structure, that is integrated into classrooms as both support and the means to develop learning competences. This integration of digital educational technology in schools and universities transforms learning contexts, but it also creates risks for all educational roles in terms of privacy and data security that must be addressed. In the last 9 years, technology adoption has been accompanied by a data-driven model of analysis and decision-making, as well as a migration to cloud computing. Cloud computing adds to this technological transformation the ubiquity of data, personal data, and metadata. This implies in many cases that third parties collect and process educational data from all the actors involved in the teaching-learning process on remote servers and data centers, outside the control of educational institutions. So this latest technology adoption unfortunately also facilitates leaks, misuse, and improper access to all data collected. In this paper, we propose seven principles as a fundamental framework for NCA, that we have called Local Educational Data Analytics (LEDA). Our aim is to solve or minimize the negative impact of the use of this educational technology, which is based on cloud computing and uses integrated data analysis processes. We also propose both technological solutions that comply with the framework and lines of research that will be incorporated into the NCA pilot tests during the academic year 20-21."

However, this type of treatment, that is similar to the used originally by the Persians in the 10th century, has some disadvantages, that are still present nowadays. It usually causes discomfort due to the weight (around 1,5kg) and the restrictions to refresh the skin. Moreover, it is not submersible and it is not possible to apply certain kind of treatments, like ultrasounds or infrared. It also may appear complications at the vascular, muscular or even articular level due to these problems.This project aims to show there is a really possible option that would solve these inconvenient. Moreover, it would allow a faster and better recovery, combining 3D prototyping, 3D scanning, medicine, engineering and materials evolution. This study proposes the use of sensor integration inside the splints to detect any kind of problem during the treatment process. These sensors get different data like pressure, color, humidity and temperature from the splint. After that, these parameters are analyzed to determine any unexpected evolution and sent by telematic channels to be consulted remotely by a specialist."

So students have the chance to settle on a learning strategy most suited to their abilities, while education is streamlined to satisfy the requirements of the individual in question. Due to the on-going technological change, we are witnessing, Robots are getting an integral component of our society and have great potential in being utilized as an academic technology by providing students with a highly interactive and hands-on learning experience. Indeed, Robotics promises to inspire a replacement generation of learning. With the aim of understanding how students can use robots to review, we created and implemented a learning scenario through an ontological conceptual Model for Personalized Learning supported Educational Robots. This model enables us to supply inferences over learning data and supply personalized learning resources, adapted to the progress of the scholar within the learning process."

In Peru, face-to-face studies were suspended and virtualized education was established as an alternative. Doctoral students took advantage of the new way of on-line learning, even without being prepared for it. The need to have categories of perception on virtualized doctorate courses was raised. The objective was to design an online perception instrument on virtual learning of doctoral studies in the context of COVID-19. The research was qualitative with phenomenological design, theoretical validation and expert opinion. The sample was non-probabilistic and a posteriori. In-depth interview was applied. Categorization based on the saturation principle and the triangulation technique were used. 40 units of analysis, 20 study categories, 42 subcategories and 30 items were obtained. It was concluded that there are four categories to design the online instrument: quality, characteristics, advantages and satisfaction."

However, during the learning process itself, students are able to create complementary knowledge to that of the teaching staff. In this research work, students have managed the knowledge that is created continuously during teamwork in a university subject. As the people who compose a team create knowledge both individually and cooperatively, students share knowledge with the rest of the class through a knowledge repository. The work has shown that students classify knowledge into two large blocks: assessment and learning. Likewise, the amount and type of knowledge created has been measured, as well as the perception of the use of collective knowledge in learning.The questions belong to the Likert scale of 1-5, where 1 is “never” 5 is “always”.The questions were asked to all students participating in this research, but were asked in two groups. One group was made up of the people who were leading the teams and the other group was made up of all the people who had not been leaders.On the one hand, out of a total of 16 possible “leaders” the survey was answered by 16 people, which means the 100% of the leaders. On the other hand, out of a total of 81 participants in the experience who were not the leaders, answered the questions Q1 and Q2 a total of 76 people (93% of the participants of this group) and to the question Q3 a total of 44 people (a 54% of the total). The results are reflected in Table 6for the people who acted as leaders and in Table 7 for the rest."

For this, the application of thermal stress is used, by immersing the hands in cold water to visualize the reperfusion of the hands. Learning, based on the visualization and analysis of thermographic images, allows the acquisition of specific competences at the university level. In graduate studies such as physiotherapy and nursing, the use of virtual tools and materials that allow the acquisition of skills and technical knowledge is essential for the job performance of future professionals. The application of this methodology is proposed in practical sessions of subjects in the area of knowledge of Physiology, to demonstrate and facilitate the understanding of the circulatory system. This approach is framed within the discipline of virtual laboratories since the virtual materials generated can be used for the acquisition of skills and practical competencies, as well as for the evaluation of competencies in e-learning courses. In this way, by recording a pedagogical video that shows a short practice, 5 minutes long, it is possible to establish the necessary knowledge bases to expand them later. This material is easily implementable in any learning management system."

Virtual expositions are non-linear multimodal web installations that facilitate the creation of interconnections through which the research as practice and the practice as research are highlighted and communicated more effectively. Through a specific virtual exposition platform, we created a visual and performative representation of a rhizomatic learning course, allowing visitors to experience the complexity, multiplicity, unpredictability, and multivoicedness of such an approach in an isomorphic way. A complex learning rhizome is a performative confluence of human and non-human actors that engages people, resources, processes, and contextual parameters. As such, it is impossible to be represented in any representational format. The virtual exposition developed here attempts to offer a fair approximative model of rhizomatic learning which is far better than text-only linear representations. This paper offers a new view to rhizomatic learning as an applied practice that can enhance teaching and catalyze learning through complex synergies and dynamics. The originality of this paper lies in its attempt to bridge linear with non-linear academic research formats in order to offer a multimodal and performative model of rhizomatic learning. Theoretical and practical implications for learning and teaching are discussed."

In this paper, we analyze the implementation of distant learning in foreign language subjects (French L2 and Translation from French to Spanish). To analyze data accurately, we have used subjects with similar methodology, tools and teachers in the last years. By doing so, we are able to isolate and describe the effect of confinement in learning through the comparison of students’ performance during the 2020 confinement and those of previous years. The main results show that students' reaction to confinement was positive, with more commitment handing in all or most of the assignments. This could be one of the factors resulting in better and increasing scores through the confinement. Finally, we also show some significant decreasing scores during the gradual release in May."

The initial objective of the work was to know the didactic and methodological strategies developed by the colleges and schools classified as most innovative, by Spanish national newspapers or by educational magazines. The students have carried out a study on the educational centers, working collaboratively in small groups, and have been able to learn about the didactic strategies they were using for the development of teaching, during the period of confinement. The presentation of on-line works has been carried out by videoconference, carrying out the evaluation by peers. Finally, the tools used for the development of the seminar on the Studium virtual campus have been analyzed by the students."

In accordance with the above, below are the results of an investigation developed with the purpose of contributing to know the causes for which there is a low level of participation of Ecuadorian women in the STEM areas. For this purpose, two instruments were developed for high school students and students in the last levels of the careers offered by the Faculty of Engineering in Applied Sciences of the Universidad T\'{e}cnica del Norte (UTN). The results obtained reflect that the high school students, who have not yet decided on their university career, show that they are interested in learning more about the areas of engineering. On the other hand, the most relevant aspect in the answers of the engineering students was that before starting their career they were most concerned about being able to obtain good results with their accumulated knowledge. All of the above leads us to develop motivational programs that allow us to capture the interest of female students in STEM careers by emphasizing the strengths and possibilities of success in this important field."

Statistics gathered through numerous research show that women make up a lesser percentage in the workforce, and girls and women are limited in their training to delve into these fields of study. The project described and presented in this manuscript is one of these efforts: The Women in Action project had a specific goal: To help women in vulnerable situations to develop their digital and entrepreneurship skills in Monterrey and Tijuana, Mexico. The workshop was active during the years 2017 to 2019. This document describes the core elements of the program, it's theoretical framework and some of the results gathered from video interviews and field notes taken by the facilitators during its active period, in order to help share the experience and lessons gathered through the extension of this project. The core message that wants to be delivered through this document is the following: If given the opportunity, women from diverse backgrounds demonstrated a fierce thirst for knowledge to hone their digital literacy skills. More efforts to provide these sorts of opportunities in the future will definitely have an impact in the long run if we want to reduce the gap of STEM."

We conducted a series of workshops in the primary schools of city of Joensuu in eastern Finland, focusing on training the fundamental computational thinking (CT) skills by using a programmable and interactive Teddy Bear toy. Educational robotics and physical computing devices have proved to be an efficient way to teach these skills regardless the students’ age group or previous background. To assess the students’ intrinsic motivation towards Teddy Bear programming, we devised a survey for workshop participants and conducted a statistical analysis to compare differences between the genders and age groups. The results of the large-scale empirical study (n=1440) show that the students at the age of 9-10 years (Grades 3-4) are significantly more motivated towards such a learning tool than the students of age 11-12 years (Grades 5-6). Furthermore, we show that especially young girls find the Teddy Bear programming motivating and they are eager to learn more. This indicates that appealing tools play a key role when teaching programming and CT concepts to young school children."

This paper introduces an experience that implemented several of the students' requests in an online exam and conducts a comprehensive analysis of students’ behavior according to the virtual learning environment records. Different existing software tools are used for the analysis, complemented with a Python application ad-hoc developed. The objective indicators gathered provide evidence that some students cheated and invite focusing on evidence-based assessment."

Diabetic foot is one of the several conditions associated to this disease, which in the most severe cases might be the cause of amputations on the lower limbs. Such condition involves a high social impact for patients and families, and puts an important burden on the health and care systems. It is essential to aim at an early detection of the pathology and at its continuous monitoring in order to perform a convenient follow-up of those patients’ condition, from both the preventive and the therapeutic viewpoints. Following this line, different decision support methodologies are nowadays under development within the remote medicine framework, that in this specific case might help to improve the process for monitoring and treating patients that are likely to develop wounds associated with diabetic foot condition.This communication, framed in the previously introduced context, aims to carry out the conceptual adaptation of the decision support methodology presented by the authors in a previous work, which addressed the prevention and monitoring of patients likely to develop wounds associated to diabetic foot condition. The revised methodology, complemented by the use of expert systems, will allow to generate alerts associated to the evolution of foot wounds in at-risk diabetic patients, by means of the interpretation and combined use of: a set of data coming from a test, a picture, and the opinions and considerations provided by an expert in the topic. Said information is fed into two concurrent inference systems, which produce a number of risk indicators that, after being appropriately combined, determine a final alert associated to a measurement of diabetic foot condition risk. Even if this system is at the moment at an active development stage, it is expected that its usage will make possible to improve the process for an early detection of the potential issues associated with diabetic foot condition, as well as the monitoring of its associated pathologies."

Even though playing video games for hours is not inherently negative, finding the boundaries between healthy and harmful habits is one of the challenges that must be addressed in our time, especially when the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) is now officially accepted. Games are a leisure activity, but behind them we can find corporations that will go to great lengths to get players engaged at a all times, crossing ethical boundaries if necessary, to get to that end. Therefore, it is very important that players, and especially children, can recognize the psychological mechanisms used in the engagement process of a game and become critical of them. This paper presents the design of a group activity that aims at reflective learning about one's behavior when playing video games, but without demonizing them validated by psychologists and psychopedagogues."

A comparative study between Spain, Italy and Ecuador focuses on the usage of smartphones and content consumption during March-May 2020. Data gathering was made with the design of a questionnaire applied to a sample of 3oo undergraduate students of Journalism, Communication and Education from three public universities. Quantitative methodology was used for this descriptive-comparative study among three different countries.Results obtained show high access to technological equipment in general, with specific increase in smartphones and laptops usage being the two devices that have experienced a greater increase in use. Regarding the consumption of information, informative contents on the COVID-19, news data about the virus, as well as the statistics of progress of the contagions occupy first place. It is worth mentioning that, in the opinion of the young people surveyed, they have been able to recognize fake news and have avoided its spread, thus understanding the notion of Infodemic, established by the World Health Organization.Conclusions allow us saying that online news channels and media were the most consumed, as were social networks, which grew among youngest as channels of communication, and verified consumption of news on official channels and government spokespersons."

The results have been very disappointing and, from their publication, one could have the impression that, first, Spanish researchers do not achieve more than a mediocre result in transferring the research to the society; second, female researchers are even less capable of transferring knowledge in a profitable, beneficial way; and third, those activities that do not involve a high economic impact, either on the Society or on the research institutions, do not count for promotion or the consideration of prestige of researchers in this research aspect. However, a close examination of the results with the help of a questionnaire elaborated by researchers belonging to a Spanish feminist association show that the very bad results could in fact be due to the intricate call and the low preparation of the evaluation committees in gender aspects, as well as the immature process in general. The conscious analyses of the results with the help of 513 respondents may help in enriching the next calls, avoiding a second disastrous result, and encouraging female researchers to contribute for advancing towards an equal society, even if no economic values are directly derived from their research."

Our paper presents the perception of students and teachers, how by using the Project-Based Learning (PBL) approach and using a gamified and interactive Virtual Reality (VR) system in the context of Building, Urban and Architecture studies we can re-force the acquisition of visual management competences. To improve the spatial competences and the visual understanding of 3D complex models for re-organizing the urban space, we have designed an educational proposal based on free applications where the students must design, create and integrate ephemeral architecture proposals for a citizenship final urban interaction. This step incorporates to the student's assessment an informal feedback, which complements the formal evaluation and gives them a point of view based on valuable social data for further projects. However, the lack of standards, the complexity of the software, the learning times, and the teacher's rejection to use these approaches, many times due to lack of interest or because of the digital gap derived from age and the classical workflows, are factors that are complicating the modernization of the learning process, establishing a low level of implantation and student's use in other subjects, as our study demonstrates. For these reasons, we have conducted an explorative research to compare the perception of the students and the teachers, with the clear result, that shows that nowadays in Architecture education, we can find a gender, and age gap in the acceptation of these systems, something that blocks their training, while in the professional sector are used and demanded."

This project is born from the exploration of the educational possibilities of Virtual Reality in higher education. Therefore, the objective of this study is to validate the use of the VR platform ""Medical Studium"" for the teaching-learning process of medical students. For the evaluation a sample of 19 students have been selected from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Salamanca (Spain), using both quantitative and qualitative data. Objective evidence and a questionnaire have been used as a data collection instrument. The results show that it helps them to better study some concepts that may seem difficult for students, as well as how to solve the limitation problems they have regarding the training of surgical operations. In addition, students are more motivated thanks to interaction with virtual and immersive content and they can reproduce a lesson as many times as they need. These findings can mean a change in both teaching and learning, as it is an improvement for students in their practical training."

However, there still exists a notable gap in STEM education participation according to gender.This quantitative research work aims to know the attitudes towards gender equality and coeducation shown by Compulsory Secondary Education students (grades 7 to 10). The sample was composed by 335 students aged 12-16 from three different secondary education schools located in the Autonomous Community of Castilla y Le\'{o}n. In order to gather data on student attitudes towards gender, we applied an anonymous questionnaire using a valid and reliable instrument. The descriptive and inferential analysis results show relatively low levels of sexist attitudes among the students participating in the study, although some differences can be found according to the gender of the respondent. Generally, women hold attitudes that are more positive towards gender equality than those held by men. The discussion and conclusions address the need to continue this research line on factors related to gender issues, as well as to implement interventions based on the principles of coeducation, so that our education system, and thus our society, come closer to a real gender equality, thus improving the chances of women to undertake all kinds of studies and jobs."

The time of exposure to a device with Internet and certain previous psychological pathologies are the two main factors that trigger an Internet addiction or excessive use. The educational programs proposed so far to reduce, or control Internet addiction are based on an expository, traditional and non-participatory methodology focused on informing students about the dangers of developing an Internet addiction. These educational programs are having good but timid results. Therefore, this article reviews the approach of a sample of programs and presents a new methodological proposal focused on increasing digital competence controlling that Internet addiction is not increased."

Unlike other annotation approaches, the present proposal primarily has an instructional purpose that allows practitioners to experiment with annotation mechanisms from an academic perspective. The approach proposed is complemented by the Clavy system to retrieve clinical corpora coming from multiple medical repositories and convert them into reconfigurable digital collections. Its application, together with the development of the CARS annotation plug-in, has enabled the instructional deployment of multimedia-based radiology collections, thus making them available as educational resources. A case study has been used to show the potential of this approach and its possibilities to annotate and analyze different examples of radiology reports."

It is noted that teachers were well informed about innovative educational projects and they wanted support by their principal and their colleagues. Experiential seminars by specialized scientists were also considered as necessary. Applications of new technologies were considered to particularly contribute to the implementation of innovative projects. Data analysis did not reveal significant gender differences in teachers’ views. Results are of particular value for the design of training programs and the integration strategies of new technologies in the design of innovative educational projects.

In the first place, the study aims to analyze all the implications that this stage entails and are addressed, with its main characteristics and, above all, emphasizing the implicit cognitive framework. This lead to observe why adolescents are more likely to get carried away by what is published through social networks. Secondly, it addresses how the process of construction of our identity is discussed, a process that develops in the stage of adolescence and youth, after childhood and before adulthood. Thirdly, this identity construction is placed in the current context, specifically, in the current digital age, with the premise that social networks are the main precursors of this developing identity. This is why in the fifth point of the paper, the presence, or rather, omnipresence of digital devices and social networks will be analyzed with greater emphasis. In the sixth point, the construction of a digital identity is presented, an identity built in parallel to the real one. The paper seeks to understand why this construction represents a strong dilemma for young people when trying to combine both, but at the same time differentiating them from each other. This means that young people have to learn to identify themselves and differentiate themselves from others, while finding a certain congruence between what they are, what they are not and what they show to others. Finally, as a way of conclusion, we emphasize in the importance of the adult guiding in this process of identity construction. The importance of a critical education is highlighted, which leads to the development of analytical and reflective thinking, which questions in depth what youngers see on social networks, while trying to build their own personal version of themselves and the world around them."

Most issues identified were related to low-level concepts. Moreover, students proved unable to identify these issues and solve them by practicing. They tended to get frustrated not knowing the causes of their failures. This design proposal starts with minimal exercises requiring a single step to be solved. Classical exercises are decomposed into these single steps. Simplicity of these exercises helps generating many instances automatically. Design focus is placed on previously identified issues. Designed exercises are composed in a pyramidal model of knowledge. To motivate students to carry out many of the proposed exercises, Gamification techniques are used. Designed exercises are automated using Moodle questionnaires. These questionnaires are contextualized as adventure activities in a role play story line, including Quests, Dungeons, Weapons and Bosses. Rules are designed according to this context.

Overall, gender representation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics degrees in Europe is not balanced. The Leaky Pipeline phenomenon, marked by gender stereotypes, makes the latent gender gap a relevant topic of study. Studies exist on academic performance, self-perception, self-efficacy, outcome expectations; however, studying gender stereotypes linked to STEM studies is also essential. It is necessary to know the social and family context in which young people have grown up, as well as their perception of such studies. To study gender stereotypes of university students about STEM studies, a questionnaire has been designed for empirical validation. For the design of the instrument, to be validated, items from other instruments have been taken and adapted to Spanish. After the design of the instrument, an online pilot study has been applied in the University of Salamanca, the University of Valencia and the Polytechnic University of Valencia. A total of 115 people answered the questionnaire. The results of the pilot study reveal that the study sample is not particularly marked by gender stereotypes about gender equality in STEM. Also, the sample is receptive to learning about science and applying it in their lives. On the other hand, the idea that women have to give up their studies and careers to look after their families and children is rejected. The idea that men are more interested in university studies than women is also rejected. At the same time, the sample is aware of the difficulties that women encounter in the STEM sector. Another optimistic point of the results is that there are no alarming data on bad experiences due to gender. In the future, the study will be replicated on a larger scale."

In recent years, advances in technology have generated a considerable and extensive wave of changes and transformations in all areas of life, including the self. In the case of young people, the effects of this hyperconnectivity are being experienced with greater intensity since they are in the middle of their identity development. Hence, digital devices may be influencing the identity definition of our younger generations. Due to the importance of the construction of the self, we should pay attention to this phenomenon from a pedagogical and anthropological perspective. In this sense, the aim of these paper is twofold: on the one hand, to provide an explanation for the construction of the self in a digital world. And, on the other hand, from a neutral position, considering that technologies are neither intrinsically liberating nor completely trap or enslave us, but depend on our thoughts and uses, we present the project CONNECT-ID, its phases, objectives, hypothesis, methodological framework, and any possible unanswered questions."

It is necessary to have tools to assess students in online education, even when they carry out activities that are most common in face to face contexts such as teamwork. In order to do so, different methodologies and learning analytics tools can be employed. However, in a complete online context the students not only interact with the asynchronous tools that educational platforms provide but they also use instant messaging tools. This paper describes a Learning Analytics tool that facilitates teachers the evaluation of students’ interactions in Telegram Instant Messaging Tool. It has been employed in the context of the evaluation of the individual acquisition of teamwork competence. The tool has been tested in a computer science course. It had associated an improvement on students’ grades and they show their preference in using instant messaging tools because by using them conversations are more natural."

Therefore, the application of three-dimensional environments for training is a new source of opportunities for teaching-learning processes. These technological innovations applied to clinical medicine, together with the rapid development of information and communication technologies, have led to the emergence of a new teaching methodology. The results of a survey carried out on a group of medical students are presented after using our computer development that allows to visualize and interact with the structures of the female pelvis reconstructed from serial high-resolution magnetic resonance sections in a virtual environment. We conducted two different surveys to the students, an initial one on the usability of portable devices and the other focused on the evaluation of radiological anatomy software of the female pelvis.The results that we obtained in the survey carried out on the evaluation of the radiological anatomy software of the female pelvis present very positive data regarding satisfaction and learning through the use of this technological tool."

In addition, it has to be taken into account that a robotic system that has only been tested with regular users may not meet older users’ expectations. For that reason, it becomes necessary to involve the said users in the design and testing process. On the other hand, in the robotics field, it is common practice to try and reuse robotic designs and implementations in different scenarios. However, in the particular case of social robotics, many developed services and robot behaviors do not translate well between domains or even subdomains. In the present paper, we present the results of the first interaction experiments between the humanoid robot Sacarino and two groups of users: middle-aged users under lab conditions and senior users in a care facility. Sacarino is a humanoid mobile robotic platform initially designed to provide information and accompany guests in a hotel. With the current experiments, we aim to explore the extent to which the results obtained in a hotel environment can be extrapolated to the assistive environment and if a robotic system intended for senior people can operate properly in real conditions, having only been tested with regular users."

Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are a good tool to boost Climate literacy through education to address this issue due to their characteristics. We have used this tool to investigate the Climate Competence in primary and secondary teachers and developed a research program around this issue. In this paper, we look into one particular problem of the MOOCs: The high dropout rate. We discuss what are some of the reasons for this high dropout rate in the literature and describe how the MOOC can be designed to overcome this issue. We also look, into the different characteristics that online formation can have to affect this rate. We also discuss what is the dropout rate in our courses and how our design choices have improved the expected finalization rates."

Twenty-one women from different organisations and qualifications, all associated with science, technology, engineering and mathematics, participated in the study. The study has been developed within the framework of the project W-STEM - Building the future of Latin America: engaging women into STEM. The video interviews were analysed using the qualitative data support software webQDA. After defining the categories and categorising the discourse, a classical content analysis was carried out. The results obtained reveal the need to invest more energy in strategies to raise the profile of women in the sector. All of them feel a strong attraction for their studies and their profession, however, they think that the path is difficult and there is little visibility. Furthermore, all the participants encourage girls to try out STEM careers if they feel they are their vocation."

The aim of this work is to contribute with information about the feelings generated in university students and to know the main characteristics of Higher Education in Ecuador in times of pandemic. Specifically, the question What are the feelings of university students in times of the COVID-19? was answered. For this purpose, a quantitative, transversal and non-experimental research was carried out. Fifty-five unstructured anonymous interviews were conducted. It was applied to students from 16 Higher Education Institutions. Feelings were analyzed using techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and through the computer programs MATLAB and NVIVO applied to the 500 phrases, obtained from 55 interviews with an average of 47 words per phrase. When carrying out the sentiment analysis, it was obtained that approximately 64% was negative, 11% neutral and 25% positive. LDA found that the 55 interviews were explained by 2 unobserved groups represented by the word clouds of topics 7 and 14. The unobserved groups show feelings such as stress, tiredness, problems and effort that may be related to the words people, evaluation, type, education and strength. This research can be complemented with a study that allows to deepen the type of negative, neutral and positive feelings and to determine their possible causes."

For this reason, for some decades now, different international organisations have been trying to measure academic performance in order to adjust educational policies in the search for improved performance and school efficiency.One of the international bodies that has devoted a great deal of time and effort to the assessment of academic performance has been the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), aimed at evaluating the acquisition of key competences by 15-year-old students.This thesis is proposed with the objective of generating a common framework of best practices in education related to the effectiveness of schools at an international level based on the analysis of the results obtained by students in the PISA 2018 tests. To this end, we will apply a mixed model integrating a quantitative approach of multilevel analysis and a qualitative approach. The quantitative approach will help us to detect those aspects that have the greatest influence on school performance, by developing a statistical model for each of the key competences measured in PISA. In addition, we will seek to highlight those contextual factors associated with school effectiveness by going deeper through the collection of qualitative data and their analysis.We include here the first results regarding the factors associated with academic performance based on the 2018 PISA report, as well as an approach to the state-of-the-art and the basic concepts on which the thesis will be built."

And the universe of Librarianship maintains its relevance and impact on the distribution of knowledge, especially in Covid-19 times, when people need lack more information to make daily decisions. In this scenario, two stereotypes are commonly confused with reality: that the area of Librarianship concerns only the storage and loan of books in libraries and that social media, such as Instagram, can only be used for informal topics and of little relevance. The objective of this research is to recognize how the area of Library Science needs to explore more the spaces of social networks, with themes that bring society closer together, in order to demonstrate its ability to transmit information beyond the physical structures of libraries. For this purpose, through a qualitative research, a comparative analysis of the content produced in 2019 and 2020, before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, was carried out by the Brazilian library councils. Such content, published in the councils Instagram profiles, was categorized by their themes and these categories were compared in the two scenarios. As a result, a significant change was observed in the content analyzed, signaling a closer approach to topics of general interest to society and, consequently, an approach between Librarianship with society itself through a greater use of Digital Marketing tools, such as Instagram."

The casuistry that leads to dropout is different depending on the academic branches, the faculties or schools and the personal circumstances of the university students. The timing of this is also different. In a context of continuous changes and an excess of information, Universities consider the possibility of extracting early warning patterns from their databases that help to act in time in those cases where the probability of abandonment begins to be relatively high. This study proposes a two-stage methodology to extract such dropout patterns. In the first place, and depending on each faculty or university school, the model will extract the most influential factors on dropout and later, classification trees will be generated using these explanatory variables. The proposed methodology has been tested with real data from the University Miguel Hern\'{a}ndez of Elche, with data from Degrees from the year 2010 to the present (24,894 records), provided directly by the Vice-Rector's Office for Students affairs and coordination. With the computational experience that accompanies the described methodology, predictive models are capable of modelling dropout with mean accuracies close to 80%. This not only offers a real photograph of the situation of each faculty, but is supported by more than enough confidence so that the Vice-Rector's Office can design contingency plans for scenarios where dropout is presented as a very likely alternative, in case of do not intervene early."

With the closure of the institutions, thousands of teachers and millions of students will have to find new ways of teaching and learning overnight, which will be a huge challenge. We cannot expect everyone to suddenly adapt to these new times. We are aware of the numerous Internet connection problems, but it is a great time to reinvent ourselves and build the courage to test the use of technological tools already available to structure alternatives in the distance education format. Thinking outside the box can help mitigate the momentary problem, as well as collaborate to strengthen digital culture and move towards a new education.The good news is that many teachers have been putting aside prejudices and are being resilient, seeking to understand the potential of available resources, not shying away from seeking and implementing technological solutions that before the virus were seen as secondary and have now become standard tools to teach synchronous and asynchronous classes, share content, correct assignments, answer questions and exchange knowledge. In the beginning, many activities that were previously carried out exclusively in person took a longer time when they started to be performed online. But as the virtual became the new real, students became more engaged and plunged headlong into relevant online learning experiences. Through applications and software, classes continued according to the school calendar.This study aimed to understand how teachers adapted to digital resources to face the limitations caused by the pandemic. It also intends to understand the impact of digital resources on the quality of teaching, as well as on motivation and academic success."

We believe that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. All of us consider that we have an identity, a singular way of being and that this makes us unique and different from others. Nonetheless, we eventually end up leading pretty similar lives. Public life makes us the same, private life differentiates us. We, as modern individuals, value our private identity. This was not always the case, since in ancient times, it was the public subject and not the private one that stood out. However, what is a fact is that humanity has always been defined by plurality. This paper aims, firstly, to point out the importance that for humanity has the development of identity. Secondly, it tries to show to what extent this development requires times and spaces of solitude. Third, we will describe the possibilities that a young person has today in this regard in a world governed by information and communication technology (ICT). Finally, we will conclude by affirming that, if we want to raise unique and responsible individuals with moral capacity, it will be necessary to promote among young people the possibility of enjoying times and spaces of solitude; that is, times and spaces in which they can be with themselves and disconnect."

Thirtyseven girls actively took part in a summer school, while 167 students (both males and females) were tested as a controlled group.For those who attended the summer school, significant gains were observed in four measures of spatial ability - mental rotation, spatial visualization, mental cutting and paper folding. For a minority of participants, scores on one of these tests, paper folding, were lower when measured at the end of the summer school but this was an exception. Furthermore, when tested several months after the summer school, the gains in spatial ability that were made during the course were maintained indicating stability over time with regard to the improvement in spatial ability.In terms of the experience of taking the course, the feedback provided was very positive and all but one participant would recommend the summer school to other girls at this stage of high school."

The objective of this study is to create a realistic and faithful image of the LGBTQIA+ employee group studied, and to contribute to the understanding of broader sectors or population groups that have similar characteristics. Afterwards, some aspects about LGBTQIA+ groups from a consulting firm in the United States will be addressed as an area of research; an ethnographic vision about the studied LGBTQIA+ group will be presented, and finally, some considerations about the reproduction of the LGBTQIA+ identity discourse in the same consulting firm and the positive and self-affirmative contributions of the same study group will be made. Some of the research tools conducted provided an opportunity to understand the complex, rich, and supportive learning environment of the company for all employees, especially those who identify as LGBTQIA+ or allied. It is suggested that other important axes of analysis be addressed, such as the role of gender identity performance in the workplace, the field in the constructions of ""LGBTQIA+"" and in the forms of sociability of the group. At the end, lines of work are proposed to theoretically sustain the research with solid historical and theoretical categories."

More specifically, the article is focused in the geoid undulation determination, which is a critical issue in hydraulic works, land subsidence, and civil projects. So, this concept has to be learned in the Bachelor's Degree in Geomatics for the proper acquisition of competences. The approach is aimed to three-dimensional fitting techniques and statistical analysis to improve the comprehension and interpretation of the different local geoid models from the same set of field measurements, and therefore the conclusions and analysis derived from them for the subsequent Geomatic practical works. The current contribution is originated from the virtual laboratories’ paradigm, as it is proposed the use of virtual materials for the acquisition and evaluation of competences and skills in an asynchronous way, that can be use not only for and e-learning or b-learning programs, but also as support for traditional face to face programs. The present contribution will help the students to contextualize the theoretical knowledge, so better understand the challenges they will face in the working market as future professionals."

Still, the benefits of diversity remain frequently untapped for these teams, as people tend to choose others similar to them. In this study, we examine whether making users aware of the team’s diversity can impact their selections. In a study involving 120 crowd participants, working on the scenario of a crowdsourced innovation project, we tested the effects of two choice architecture and nudging techniques. The first technique displayed explicit personalized diversity information in the form of the current team diversity score and diversity recommendations. The second technique used diversity priming, in the form of counter-stereotypes and all-inclusive multiculturalism. Our results indicate that, while priming deterred participants from picking teammates of different regions, displaying diversity information was the only factor to positively enhance diverse choices. These results were not moderated by the users’ ’‘need to belong” levels, an intrinsic motivation justifying one’s need to form social ties. Other factors which we also find to predict selection behavior were the participants’ region of origin, participants’ gender, teammates’ functional backgrounds, and teammates’ order of appearance. In light of these findings, we suggest that nudging techniques need to be cautiously applied to online team formation as the different techniques differ in their ability to evoke diversity among intrinsically diverse crowds, and that personalised displaying of diversity information seems most promising."

Currently, the figures indicate a deficit of female presence in the STEM context, which implies the loss of the talent of the female collective. The school, as the transforming axis of society, must generate actions that motivate, involve and generate commitment in girls and women, enhancing their engagement in the STEM context. This paper shows two unplugged activities taken from a serial of activities implemented with elementary students and families in a digital cultural center in Madrid-Spain. The implementation is based on general objectives such as 1. To introduce and motivate interest since an early age in computer programming, 2. To develop gender dynamics that educate on gender equity to strengthen female empowerment in the STEM area. Performing the example in the roles of female gender in science, as well as transforming stereotypes with the purpose of motivate girls and adult women, without excluding the male group. The activities also seek to train Computational Thinking skills, to introduce basic computer programming concepts as well as showing that unplugged activities are important in teaching computer programming, and integrate women into the STEM area, as an important tool to reduce gender gaps. Based on our informal observations, some results were: involvement of the female collective in the construction of codes, improvement in the dynamics of gender equity in each activity and that the girls created more complex codes than males."

Usually this requires a great deal of work, dedication, and motivation from both teachers and students. Accordingly, ever since the first programming languages emerged, the problems inherent to programming teaching and learning have been studied and investigated. The theme is very serious, not only for the important concepts underlying computer science courses but also for reducing the lack of motivation, failure, and abandonment that result from students frustration. Therefore, early identification of potential problems and immediate response is a fundamental aspect to avoid student's failure and reduce dropout rates. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning (neural network) predictive model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built throughout programming classes by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities. The resulting model allows teachers to early identify students that are more likely to fail, allowing them to devote more time to those students and try novel strategies to improve their programming skills."

It constitutes a biomechanical unit and is formed by 5 lumbar vertebrae distributed in such a way that each supports a weight. The Lumbo-Sacral Spine distributes a load and acts as a shock absorber for the spine thanks to its flexibility.The knowledge of the morphology of this spinal structure and its articulation with the first sacral vertebra is fundamental to determine the biomechanical behavior of the entire spinal column. Furthermore, it allows the study of its type of support, its stability and degree of cushioning, its mobility and, in short, all its cinematic and dynamic characteristics.The present work presents a morphological study of the lumbar spine and the lumbosacral articulation of 108 non-pathological adult individuals and without regular and demanding physical or sportive physical activity. The sample consists of simple x-rays of the sagittal plane.The objective proposed in the present work is to obtain a normal lumbosacral column model of a significant population studied as a control group. Obtaining the proposed model allows knowledge and characterization of the distribution of the non-pathological population and its deviations from the most frequent values.The typing of the lumbar morphology of a control group makes it possible to have a decision tool at the population level to establish a preventive or healthy policy based on the analysis of the risks and priority criteria for action. The incidence of this model in the prevention of pathologies of the lumbar spine has a direct incidence with the labor, personal and social cost that this type of pathologies supposes."

They allow monitoring the single activity of different people working in the same project through all the project's lifetime. Thus, Version Control Systems are also used by educational institutions. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that the academic success in Computer Sciences subjects may be predicted by monitoring students' interaction with a Version Control System. In order to do so, we have built a prediction model by using Model Evaluator, a tool which allows evaluating several Machine Learning models in order to select the most suitable for a specific problem. A set of experiments are being been carried out to evaluate the prediction model. At those experiments, students of different subjects of the degree in Computer Science of the University of Le\'{o}n were involved. All the selected subjects: Operating Systems Extension, Computer Programming, and Computer Organization, require students to complete practical assignments which imply developing software solutions in different programming languages. A common requisite of those practical assignments is the use of a Git repository to store source code and documentation. Tentative results suggest that continuous interaction with the Git repositories has a big impact on academic success."

It is required by the teacher, a careful process of selection based on criteria such as the level of knowledge, examples of real applications, video length, and clarity of mathematical development. After watching the material, a final form must be completed by the students to focus on the milestones. Students have access to the material at the end of the course, small groups can watch videos that last approximately 3 minutes, from their smart phones using the wireless network. The questions to answer seek to identify the level of understanding of the concepts used and to identify the weaknesses of each subject. Thus, the viewing around 10 videos allow reviewing the most important issues of the course's content. It is motivating the review of the topics in a simple and fast way because the confidence level of the student increases before the final test. The strategy for the development of games in the classroom should be voluntary, anonymous, with a reduced cost of time. Kahoot and Socrative are used to review concepts of the course. The quiz let diagnose weak points on the learning process in the classroom."

The quick evolution of these technologies, their dissimilarities with traditional approaches, and the broad skills set required to master them, might prevent existing professionals working in industry to gain high quality knowledge and experience in Big Data related areas. Therefore, universities and teaching professionals must propose feasible and effective alternatives to train professionals and students in these topics. The purpose of this paper is to present the Master as a Service (MaaS) approach, that is currently being used to train students in Big Data- related areas (e.g., eHealth, Digital Transformation, etc.), following a multidisciplinary, Project Based Learning strategy. More specifically, students coming from different master's degrees and undergraduate backgrounds (ranging from management studies to computer engineering, including architects, social and physical sciences) are trained to address latent and future challenges in Big Data and High-Performance Computing technologies by combining their profiles, and exposing them to real-world challenges that require the very best of each different profile. The results obtained from the implementation of the MaaS approach during the last two years in terms of both student satisfaction and employability rate, confirm the benefits of this method and encourage practitioners to keep working in this direction."

Boosting these digital skills and media literacy as necessary requirements in the digital society are viewed as essential, and must be included in the educational curriculum. In general programs and educational policies, the key issue for implementing effective measures and specific actions is to foster critical thinking within media literacy education to achieve a true integration of media and digital skills in educational contexts.In this regard, this essay presents a research project for an effective and active inclusion of media literacy; for critical participation of citizens in the digital society. The main goal of the study presented, although the project has broader scopes, is to first conduct in-depth review of the state of the art in order to compare international models and issues. The study of media literacy and digital competences will help establish the main dimensions for this study.This project aims to provide evidence-based guidance to those responsible for the education of children and young people on the proper use of the available digital media tools and knowledge, that is, teachers and families. To achieve this objective a first step is taken in the reviewing of national and international studies and programs by collecting different proposals of dimensions in the study of media literacy and digital skills. The result is a design of key dimensions for the present study that will serve to collect data demonstrating the impact that digital media are having in the new consumption habits of children and young people outside of the classroom. These dimensions will be the bases for the design of an assessment instrument."

With this tool, teachers can develop applications and video games that help students to learn fundamental concepts of mathematics through programming. The implementation of the integer division algorithm firstly in App Inventor, and later in C++ using successive subtractions required a detailed explanation of this algorithm. We have implemented an algorithm that uses the integer division theorem in response to a problem detected among mathematics teachers interested in teaching programming. This study involved 19 participants in 4 institutions in Palmira and Medell\'{\i}n (Colombia). The results indicated that the programming languages such as C++, Java and Python presented the erroneous results in the integer division when the divisor is a negative number, a similar situation to that was observed among the participants who presented quotients and incorrect residues in most cases. Using App Inventor in a programming course with teachers Maths allowed us to enrich the application with a video game for the student' self-evaluation in relation to the appropriation of the algorithm of the division of integer numbers."

On the other hand, as in many academic fields, the value of different perspectives in the research process is progressively recognized, integrating not only diverse disciplines but also the knowledge from non-academic roles. At the confluence of these two emerging paradigms, the uncertainty surrounding the data, information and knowledge generated by data visualization and transdisciplinarity approaches represents a methodological and a technical challenge. Through complementary methods of participatory design and a survey to DH scholars, we propose the prototype of a participatory material for working sessions that can help to reflect a collaborative visualization of types of uncertainty in the field of DH, especially for early phases of awareness and familiarization with the topic. As a result of a first cycle of iterations with 14 participants in a workshop, and the inputs of 50 survey respondents, we propose a canvas model adapting the Johari window which allows to visualize and share examples of knowledge uncertainty around research datasets, integrating diverse emerging taxonomies in this field of study."

Matrices and their operations are some example of this. This can be related to the lack of contextualization in some area of interest, which makes the student thinks that the concept learning without applications is meaningless. For this reason, it is important to present mathematical concepts in a contextualized manner in some area of interest. This paper presents the construction of a Learning Object (LO) for matrix operations and an application in digital image processing. This work carried out aims to investigate the effects produced by the use of the LO and the C ++ programming language for digital image processing, in the operations and application matrices learning process. The LO construction process followed the phases of the ADDIE model. The results obtained during the implementation and evaluation phase of the model are presented. The LO was implemented in the course of Programming for Sciences, and seven students of the Bachelor of Mathematics of the University of Guadalajara participated in the focus group session. The results show the proposal is interesting, easy to use and it has a good educational potential. The evidence shows that the learning was achieved satisfactorily, since the visualization and reasoning processes are observed in the worksheets."

The main advantages of this new method for modeling muscles is that several position of a joint, where the muscle is involved, could be analyzed without any added effort to the original meshing of the model. We only need to locate the bones involved in the joint in their new position, and so the muscles will move to their right position. 3D models allow us to study in a more detailed manner the muscle stress maps, deformations, but the main issue we must work on is the need of re-meshing the 3D geometry any time the joint changes in position. With this simplified method, only its insertion points, the section and the length, define the muscle, in the FEA. And none of the changes when the joint changes in position."

In the analysis carried out by Entwistle and McCune [1] on the conceptual bases of the study strategies inventories, it is established that there is no consensus on the terms used to refer to the various behaviors that relate to the activity of study and this is why the authors use terms such as study strategies, study processes, study styles, study approaches and study skills to refer to the same behaviors. Biggs et al. [2] in its Study Process Questionnaire (SPQ), which is one of the most used questionnaires to measure study skills, proposed a structure that may be relevant in the evaluation of the construct Study Skills, because it encompasses the deep and superficial aspects enunciated by Marton and S\""{a}lj\""{o} [3], but, in turn, subdivides them into strategies (which can be understood as specific actions) and motives (referring to the elements that drive these actions). It is important to notice that Mexican culture has particular characteristics that may lead to different behaviors from those of students from other cultures such as the Anglo-Saxon. The method consisted of three stages each of which sought to generate evidence of validity from different sources for a table of specifications for the construction of an inventory of study skills for Mexican college students. The resulting indicators in the sub-dimension Surface strategy were 7; the sub-dimension Surface motivation was made up of 4 indicators; the sub-dimension Deep strategy was delimited by 11 indicators; the sub-dimension Deep motivation was constituted by 4 indicators. Finally, 26 indicators that delimit the construct Study Skills were detected."

The scientists of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) consider that an increase of 2 °;C with respect to the temperature of the pre-industrial era is the limit for dangerous and catastrophic changes in our planet Earth. For this reason, the international community has recognized the need to improve our mitigation and adaptation policies, where education has an important role as an agent to create awareness, train and mobilize young people in the face of the challenges of Climate Change. Although the role of Education is recognized, it is not fully implemented as a strategic resource. The motivation of this project is to create an objective diagnosis of the current state of formal education on Climate Change, propose new strategies to develop the important tasks that Education must complete on this issue and finally, building new concepts and frameworks to push the role of Education as a real solution. We have introduced the new concept of Climate Competence. which organizes knowledge, awareness and skills. The work also includes creating tools to evaluate the efficiency and fitness of traditional curriculums and new education tools such as online reaching or MOOCs."

This revolution goes beyond purely technological aspects, changing our behaviors and opening the door to new risks. The British TV series Black Mirror, one of the most successful dystopias dealing with technology in the current television scenario, deepens into the different uses and effects of those technologies, allowing the identification of possible risks that come together with the new socio-technological paradigms. To study this, a content analysis of all 22 chapters broadcasted until today was conducted. We observed that social media, smartphones and tablets and technological implants in humans are the most present technologies; technology is depicted under a rather negative perspective in the series, with generally negative effects over societies, and full of risks. The most relevant of them are the loss of privacy or security, the lack of distinction between the real and the virtual world and the development of addictive behaviors. The similarities with the reality of the target public make this series a potential tool to educate or warn about those matters."

These nerve tracts and the specific location of their nerve fibers have been known for over 40 years. However, the study of these tracts can be difficult to understand, because these structures are not easily isolated for an in vivo anatomical study. Therefore, in this work we want to analyze and present the somatotopic arrangement of the nerve tracts in the internal capsule. To do so, we will use the information obtained from a magnetic resonance sequence with post-processing software to create the tractographic representation of this area."

From this aspect, the formation of students from the first teaching degree becomes important. This study evaluates the effectiveness of an educational intervention in a b-learning context for training in informational skills at the primary degree of education. In this way, a pre-experimental design with pre-test and post-test was applied to a sample of 328 elementary students in Chile, in the sector of the Province of Maipo. The data collection began with a validated instrument for evaluating performance in the four dimensions of information competencies: Search, Evaluation, Processing and Communication of the digital Information. After checking the previous assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity, the corresponding statistical tests were applied in the data analysis. The results establish an increase in the learning of informational competences based on the application of the educational intervention."

The present work is framed inside the virtual laboratories discipline, as the new learning material can be employed for the acquisition of competences and skills. Additionally, it can be used for the evaluation of competences in asynchronous and e-learning programs. The learning materials could be easily deployed in a learning management system, allowing the students to work with the models by means of open-source solutions easily, both in asynchronous and face-to-face courses. Consequently, the present approach will improve the application of professional techniques, so the future professionals will reach the working market better prepared."

To address this problem, which falls within the scope of prediction, it is appropriate to resort to classification techniques that model academic performance as a discrete variable, even if that variable has a continuous nature.This article presents a methodology based on the hypothesis that the way the performance variable is discretized will significantly affect the predictive models generated. This work highlights a relation between the factorization criteria and the most-relevant attributes selected to classify instances. Also, the paper shows a relation between the predictive model obtained and the target variable factorization criteria."

It denotes that the impact must be global and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in a specific sector, for example. The innovation applied in the classroom is known as ""teaching educational innovation"" and thinking in global is complicated because innovation is carried out in a specific subject. Specific contexts have needs and conditions that difficult the transference outside the subject itself. This work provides a method to consider any teaching educational innovation in global terms, even before knowing the specific innovation method to apply. In this way, transferability would be enhanced and the global impact on the change of the educational model would be improved. For this purpose, a study has been carried out with more than 85 professors from different universities. The objective of the study is to show that they have a common vision on the indicators to measure the leaning impact when they apply teaching educational innovation in their own subjects."

In order to reach this objective, a diagnosis of the situation was firstly made, based on the results of an initial mathematical knowledge questionnaire completed by all first-year students of six engineering degrees. After analyzing the results of this test and the main mistakes made by the students, the appropriate content was selected, and an online course was designed and made available to all students groups. As a model for this initiative, it was used a pilot course that the authors had formerly developed for a small number of mechanical engineering students coming from Vocational Modules. This pilot course, which was voluntary for those students, had excellent results, both in academic achievements and involvement. However, the general course, although it reached more than 10 times the number of students in the pilot course, has shown very limited participation results, with a very strong dropout rate after the first few weeks. This paper compares both initiatives, describes general online course and shows the differences between developing courses aimed at general audiences (with a sharp decline in participation) rather than proposing courses for smaller groups that have more specific educational needs."

These reflections are analyzed from three different perspectives: how the literature review influenced the design of the didactical implementation (namely the first); how his reflection upon his practice influenced its modifications; how his research activity impacted and affected his teaching practices in the subsequent implementations and guided the modifications made. The remote lab was introduced in a Physics Course in an Engineering degree and was intended to be a learning space where students had the opportunity to practice before the lab class, supporting the development of experimental competences, fundamental in an engineer profile. After the first implementation in 2016/17 academic year it has undergone two subsequent editions with adjustments and modifications.Some features previously reported in literature such as: teacher's experience with VISIR, the importance of an introductory activity and defining VISIR tasks objectives, were corroborated by the teacher during his practice and research. Others, such as the difficulty some students have in understanding the difference between simulation and remote labs appeared directly from his practice and were pursued in his research in order to deeply understand its implications."

Despite the disappointing results in the statistics of completion of the courses, specialists suggest moving the attention from the completion of these to focus on the intentions of the students. Meanwhile, researchers have mainly studied the obstacles why students do not finish MOOCs, but little has been studied about what the success factors are for the participants. The present investigation tries to study specifically the adult participants, divided into three age groups, to compare which are the most influential factors to finish a MOOC. In this research, participants from different Spanish-speaking countries were chosen (n = 1978) to compare the factors that most influenced them to complete a MOOC. It was identified that among the age groups of adults, the most relevant factor to finish a MOOC were the personal factors; which may include the way of studying or how the student organizes her o his time."

PhD students that join the profession have a growing number of opportunities to form themselves in transversal communication and media competencies, including technologies such as social media, which strengthen their profile. The use of the most popular social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or YouTube is already common in this new context. Previous studies have proven the existence of a relationship between the perception of obtaining future rewards with a technology (performance Expectancy), the difficulty its use implies (effort Expectancy) and the opinion of the social environment (social influence), and the real use of said technology.Based on the theoretical model of UTAUT (Unified Theory of Adoption and Use of Technologies), our hypothesis is that existence of an indirect conditional effect of the performance Expectancy, the effort Expectancy and the social influence over the real use of social media for science communication by PhD student, and that this effect is mediated by the intention of use and moderated by gender and age.Our goal is to analyze the mechanisms that cause said effect in doctoral students of the PhD in Education in the Knowledge Society of the University of Salamanca.We surveyed the 180 students of the program, so that we could know the level of adoption of social media for science dissemination and the variables that influence the intention of use and the real use of them. The UTAUT model is partially confirmed and the results of the moderated mediation prove that the performance Expectancy, the effort Expectancy and the social influence in the students affect the real use of these media."

In this study, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest were used. These algorithms trained a model that could predict the academic success of college-level engineering students. Under an experimental model with 182 students, three instructors leading six groups of Physics II for engineering majors of the Tecnologico de Monterrey (Mexico) administered adaptive measures for one group each and not for the other of their groups (the control groups). Three forecasts were calculated considering structured academic information (numerical grades) and unstructured academic information (student ID pictures). Unstructured data from the facial photograph and numeric academic information from the first evaluation period were considered for the study. The results show a significant difference between the control and experimental groups of only one instructor, while the results of the other two instructors' control and experimental groups were consistent. One finding of this study is that, despite the prediction not being correct for each student, a general picture of the performance of the group was given. It seems that the algorithm must be trained with more data for the forecast to be more precise in the future."

Based on knowledge of the existence of gender stereotypes in relation to the use of the Internet, the objective of the study is to detect whether the age of young people, with some previous experience on the Internet, marks differences in relation to the use they make of the Internet; in other words, whether the use made of the world network and the existing stereotypes may or may not have some type of dependent relationship with the age of the subjects. The study was applied in a group of the University of Salamanca (Spain) during the academic year 2018/2019, after the previous realization of activities during four months of sensitization, under the European project WYRED (netWorked Youth Research for Empowerment in the Digital). The final sample was composed by 48 subjects. For this purpose, a questionnaire was applied with 40 final items, which collected different activities that can be carried out on the Internet in order to find out what trend of use they presented in relation to the Internet, in comparison to their age. The two groups consisted of 26 people aged 20 or younger, and 22 people aged 20 or older. By means of a descriptive analysis, and the application of normality tests and non-parametric tests, no dependent relationships were detected between the use of the Internet after carrying out the survey and the age group in which the subject belonged. For the future it would be of special interest to be able to repeat the study comparing the opinion and use of young people on the Internet according to gender."

The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of teamwork and classroom response systems (well-recognized teaching and learning strategies), applied in a mechanical engineering subject, in the academic performance of Chinese students who receive their teachings in Spanish. The study was conducted in a quasi-experimental design. The target group was all third-year students (n = 71) from School of Mechanical Engineering in Xiangtan University for three consecutive academic years. We compared their academic performance in two subjects, one that implements two methodologies (teamwork and response systems in the classroom) and another with the conventional lecture-based method. The results obtained by the current study showed higher student engagement and a significant improvement in the subject in which the new methodologies were applied."

A review of ideas around Critical Thinking is shown, and this is intended to show that Mathematical modeling can help develop this competency in the Mathematics classroom. A theoretical proposal of how we conceive Mathematical modeling and methodological proposals is presented along with elements to look at these processes in the classroom. Considering that this study focuses on the study of the articulation of mathematical modeling as a didactic strategy and on critical thinking, based on mathematical modeling activities, the level of critical thinking of engineering students who perform these modeling activities in a Differential Equations course will be evaluated."

The activity provides both visual and numerical information that the student must compare critically with respect the results obtained analytically, using the equations explained in the theoretical classroom. The activity is designed so that it can be integrated quickly (due to the shortage of times in the academic calendars). In this manner its total completion does not exceed four hours of simulation class. This is achieved by optimizing the resources, proposing meshing and simulation strategies that consume little computational time and using the package Solidworks® Flow Simulation, that takes advantage of the geometry parametrically modelled with the software itself to automatically establish the computational domain of the fluid for the based-on CFD analysis, saving excessive preparation times and long computational process."

This under-representation becomes evident as the academic and professional scale progresses, making representation figures smaller at higher levels. This is due to the existence of stereotypes about the presence in the technological and scientific sector. Thus, horizontal segregation occurs. Intervention proposals for awareness-raising and recruitment are the result of empirical studies carried out using different methodologies and instruments, which have made it possible to survey reality. The present review of instruments arises within the framework of the doctoral thesis that studies the situation of the gender gap in the field of technological and scientific education, within the European framework. This thesis is developed from the mixed approach, giving rise to the sequencing between quantitative and qualitative techniques, for the subsequent triangulation. To this aim, it has been necessary to analyse which instruments are being used in the investigations with the greatest impact, in order to be able to follow their footsteps and propose the subsequent methodological design of the investigation. The paper presents the review process of instruments and the selected five instruments that, can be key pieces for the design mentioned above."

Thus, the vibrations that we receive in the different vehicles we use (automobile, motorcycle, bus, train, etc.) influence our comfort and, possibly, our health.In Europe, electric bicycles and electric mini-scooters (e-scooters) are increasingly used for short trips of up to 3km according to some measures.The e-scooters have small wheels, very rigid in some cases and with low damping for driver. Most scooters have only front suspension.This combination of factors makes it necessary to study the real influence of these vibrations on the human body. For this, a methodology based on a multibody dynamic simulation model in combination with the postprocess described by the UNE-2631 standard is proposed. The UNE-2631 standard allows to assess the comfort of these vibrations as well as their possible effect on the health of the driver.This methodology suggests how to study, under simulation framework, the vibration transmitted for different velocities and road profiles. Two vehicles, more and less rigid are proposed to cover a wide range of actual e-scooters layouts."

EDM aims to facilitate the understanding of the educational context by utilizing different methods of statistics and machine learning. Like wise to the current trends in data mining, also EDM approaches have shifted from black box tools and algorithms to more open-ended tools and algorithms where the EDM end-users can adjust multiple parameters, view visualizations, and even adjust the predictive models. Multiple studies have shown that the EDM end-users benefit from the white box approaches and tools. We introduce the concept of Augmented Intelligence (AUI) method in EDM. AUI method is applied in an iterative process where a white box machine learning algorithm generates a predictive model, which is adjustable by the EDM end-user. The adjustable predictive model affects to the perception of the end-user and the adjusting affects to the output of the predictive model. When applied in cycles, the AUI method generates new knowledge from the educational context. To study AUI method, a potential EDM end-user generated multiple adjustable decision tree models and we observed the evolution of the models. The study indicates that, over time, the models generalize better and the AUI method helps to avoid the issue of overfitting. Moreover, the study indicates that the cyclic nature of the AUI method facilitates deeper knowledge generation from the dataset, if the context is known by the end-user."

These tools support visual analysis, knowledge generation, and thus, are crucial systems to assist decision-making processes. However, the design and development processes are complex, because several perspectives and components can be involved. Tailoring capabilities are focused on providing individualized dashboards without affecting the time-to-market through the decrease of the development processes' time. Among the methods used to configure these tools, the software product lines paradigm and model-driven development can be found. These paradigms benefit from the study of the target domain and the abstraction of features, obtaining high-level models that can be instantiated into concrete models. This paper presents a dashboard meta-model that aims to be applicable to any dashboard. Through domain engineering, different features of these tools are identified and arranged into abstract structures and relationships to gain a better understanding of the domain. The goal of the meta-model is to obtain a framework for instantiating any dashboard to adapt them to different contexts and user profiles. One of the contexts in which dashboards are gaining relevance is Learning Analytics, as learning dashboards are powerful tools for assisting teachers and students in their learning activities. To illustrate the instantiation process of the presented meta-model, a small example within this relevant context (Learning Analytics) is also provided."

The main problem with this technology is that, if the environmental parameters are not sufficiently controlled, inaccuracy is created between the mechanical and aesthetic properties of the product. This causes that the pieces do not meet the requirements for the market since they cannot guarantee a unified performance.For this purpose, a proof of concept that implements the necessary sensors in a testing machine will be carried out. The sensors will collect the measurements by means of an Arduino microcontroller. The obtained information will be processed in order to make the reports that indicate if the manufacturing process meets the expected requirements.With this system it is possible to improve the manufacturing results by melted deposition and to assure quality standards. In the future, the system could be improved according to the quality parameters required by the ISO standards for printing filaments and also used to certify them.Considering all the aforementioned, this is undoubtedly a field of research that still has much to develop and it is expected that this work will be a contribution for future research."

The dominant trends in the world of digital competence: mobile-apps, media literacy, digital competences, computational systems and digital learning environments, call for rethinking education taking account of ubiquitous broadband connectivity and the mass adoption of increasingly powerful mobile devices. This context leads to a new concept of citizenship in Networked societies: e-citizenship. Governments and the international community are supporting efforts to train competent citizens who are able efficiently and effectively function in this digital age, express themselves in a broad range of situations, contexts and realities, develop, acquire and implement solutions in different contexts, and use all sorts of tools and applications developed in the digital context. In this vein, we intend to gather all the available research in the field of educational mobile technologies, which play an important role in the autonomous use that students make of these resources to enhance the skills acquired in the classroom. In this sense, the communications presented, confirm that teachers are making an increasingly good use of mobile technologies in education, thereby reducing the existing gap between the educational sphere and the reality experienced by students in their daily lives."

This 'sophisticated' competence is assumed as the ability to select/modify/manage existing digital resources - linked to a specific area/topic of learning - but, above all, to adaptat/transform/create 'new' didactic resources.After having focused the ability to adapt resources within the digital competences of the teacher based on the DigCompEdu Framework and clarified the component of the 'personalization' of the intervention - 'Creating and modifying digital resources' (2.2.); 'Differentiation and personalization' (5.2) - the paper reports a case study aimed at describing how 4 teachers in a technological-mechanical course at a vocational-trade school have digitally adapted a disciplinary content ('millimeter measurement'), in order to promote learning of students with different and special needs.A single case-study has been structured through the Yin's procedures for multiple-case-study protocol: definition of the units of analysis, selection of the comparable 'entities', data analysis and triangulation.The visual material has been analyzed on three 'units of analysis': content; disciplinary content; digitalized disciplinary content. The study also provides ideas to reflect on the digitized disciplinary contents and rethink the explanatory model of TPCK in the perspective of personalization and adaptation, as well as the construct of rapport au savoir - 'relationship with one's knowledge'."

A lot of work, dedication, and motivation are required for teachers and students. Since the first programming languages have emerged, the problem of teaching and learning programming is studied and investigated. The theme is very serious, not only for the important concepts underlying the course but also for the lack of motivation, failure, and abandonment that such frustration may imply in the student. Immediate response and constant monitoring of students' activities and problems are important. With this work, it is our goal to improve student achievement in courses where programming is essential. We want each student to be able to improve and deepen their programming skills, performing a set of exercises appropriate and worked for each student and situation. We intend to build a dynamic learning model of constant evaluation, build the profile of the student. The student profile will be analyzed by our predictive model, which in case of prediction of failure, the student will have more careful attention. Predict the student's failure with anticipation and act with specific activities, giving the student the possibility of training and practicing the activities with difficulties. With this model, we try to improve the skills of each student in programming."

In this work, we analyse the answers to satisfaction surveys completed by the teachers that had attended training courses on these topics. These surveys, together with the in situ observations of the authors of this work and the opinions of students who have participated in the creation of educational materials, have motivated the development of the model OCEDiCo to design Open Course Ware courses focused on the use of ICT to create learning digital materials. This model takes into account the teachers' demands and the specific characteristics of their working context (institutional training, ICT tools availability, etc.) to collect resources and activities that guide them in a progressive and personalised way. Following this model, the course ""Support materials for the creation of multimedia educational content"" has been implemented."

An empirical-analytical methodology was used and a mixed final questionnaire was carried out. The teaching method was based on the Flipped Classroom (FC) methodology and 10 Kahoot format questions were created. The methodology used in this study was document collection procedures, questionnaire and content analysis. The data showed that 19% of 35 students had more than five hits in Kahoot and most of them attribute the errors to lack of adequate study, difficulty in responding correctly in a short time, and lack of concentration or memory. There was no rejection about the tool, since 66% of the students would recommend its use in higher education. The positive aspects of the Kahoot most cited were its usefulness, the possibility of stimulating and motivating learning by promoting or dynamism, fun, participation and competitiveness in the classes. Promoting new strategies for teaching and learning, seeking to involve and motivate students with methodologies such as Flipped Classroom is highly recommended, as digital natives are no longer satisfied with traditional classes."

However, the dropout rate of using SLT is prevailing. This research develops and tests a new psychological model to understand the role of the personality in continuing using the SLT. This study aims to examine the role of personality traits (i.e., agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness) to understand the variances in the levels of intention to continue using the MOOCs (ICM) by taking into consideration external and internal motivations (i.e., those enforced by external sources and those stemming from self-motivation). After analysis on a sample of 136 students in Spanish universities using PLS path analysis, the internal motivation plays a significant full mediating role in understanding the relationship between the personality and intention to continue use for all except for the extraversion. Extraversion is externally motivated but no evidence to support the mediating impact nor the effect on the intention to continue use. None of the personality traits found to have a significant direct impact on ICM. Internal motivation, not external motivation, is found to influence the ICM significantly. This model explains 49% of the variation in ICM. The main implication of this research is that different personalities need different motivations for their use of SLT in order to keep using them in the future. Practical implications are developed to encourage student learning using SLT."

The authors link the adaptive abilities of students with the nature of motivation for learning and the level of personal development in the process of new knowledge acquisition. The unity of the vectors of individual development in this regard correlates with the matrix of self-actualization, which characterizes the integral structure of personality and the rate of the development of its abilities in the learning process. The analysis of the parameters of self-actualization for the groups of students of different majors, which fix the positive experience of an individual in the information environment, determines the aims of the article. The theoretical basis of the study is the concept of personal development in psychology. The method of comparative analysis of the average level of self-actualization of students, depending on their major and gender, and psychological testing (self-actualization test) as an empirical method are used. Test data processing was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 19. The generalization of indicators of basic and auxiliary scales of self-actualization parameters measurement allowed revealing the average picture of readiness of students to the independent orientation in the extended learning environment. According to the results of the study, the conclusion is made about the insufficient level of independence of the first-year students in the assessment of the information environment, in the choice of online learning trajectories. The results can be used to model a productive algorithm of students' adaptation to the e-learning environment."

The sample of study presents a vulnerable rural context for being located in armed conflict zones and low socio-economic status. These students were subjected to a technological treatment (the Duolingo web application for schools, desktop version) supported by the b-Learning approach in the English Foreign language class that was attended for 4 months, one hour per week. The objective of the study comprises two hypotheses: The H1 states that there is a correlation between the academic achievements in English as a Foreign Language class, and the points of experience obtained with Duolingo. On the other hand, the H2 states that the apprehension of knowledge in the English class according to the points of experience obtained with Duolingo will be greater in women than in men. Then the objectives of this research are: to verify whether it exists a relationship between the variables of study (Academic Achievements in English as a Foreign Language class and Points of Experience awarded by Duolingo) and to contrast the variables Gender of the participants and Points of experience. The variables to analyze were the students' points of experience awarded by Duolingo supported by the b-Learning context, the gender of the students, and the academic achievements in English as a Foreign Language class. The results demonstrated that there is a significant relationship between the academic achievements in English and the use of Duolingo. Regarding the hypothesis contrast between gender of the participants and the points of experience obtained with Duolingo, it was not significant. It can be concluded that the integration of the b-Learning approach and Duolingo may be favorable in the teaching-learning process of English as a foreign language evincing a significant influence in the academic achievements of the students subjected to the technological treatment."

Thus, the provision of instruments to assist in the cataloguing of medical reports with UMLS is of utmost relevance, especially when these reports are written in unstructured free-text natural language. For this purpose, it is possible to use tools that, like MetaMap, enable the automatic annotation of clinical texts with UMLS terms. However, these tools typically work on reports written in English, which seriously hinders their applicability to other languages. In this paper, we describe an approach to mitigate these shortcomings, which pipelines state-of-the-art language translation services with automatic mapping tools. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by combining Google Translate with MetaMap and by using the resulting pipeline to catalog, with UMLS, a representative set of Spanish-written X-Ray Thorax reports corresponding to images taken from the Indiana Chest X-ray radiology corpus. The resulting cataloguing is not significantly different, in quality, from that obtained through the direct application of MetaMap on a similar set of reports written in English and selected from this Indiana Chest X-ray corpus."

""Think in parallel"" is a skill which requires time, effort, and experience. In this work, we propose to facilitate the learning process in parallel programming by using instant messaging by students. Our aim is to find out if students' interaction through instant messaging is beneficial for the learning process. We asked several students of an HPC course of the Master's degree in Computer Science to develop a specific parallel application, each of them using a different application program interface: OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, or OpenCL. Even though the used APIs are different, there are common points in the design process. We proposed to these students to interact with each other by using Gitter, an instant messaging tool for GitHub users. Our analysis of the communications and results demonstrate that the direct interaction of students through the Gitter tool has a positive impact on the learning process."

However, programming raises certain difficulties during its learning, especially in understanding programming concepts due to the high level of abstraction required. This level of abstraction can be reduced by using graphic representations that motivate the student and facilitate the understanding of certain programming concepts that arise at the beginning of the learning process. Therefore, this paper introduces ANGELA, a graphic notation based on the metaphor of roads and traffic signs that is meant to complement the learning process of beginner students who are starting to program by visualizing programs. These visualizations can be automatically generated from the source code of the programs, thanks to the modular and scalable design of the notation, and used by teachers to explain programming concepts during classes. The proposal has been evaluated with students in order to validate if the notation is appropriate to represent the concepts it tries to abstract from and if it results easy for the students to understand. Additionally, some use cases are presented in real-world scenarios in order to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposal."

It reviews different forms in which learning designs can be represented both in textual or in a graphical way. The different forms have been gathered from the options used by teachers in current practice and from proposals of the research community. The following categories have been defined to classify the several representation types into a clear and concise classification: Narrative Text; Forms/Templates; Table Representations/Matrices; Concept Maps, Mind Maps and Tree-based Representations; Flow Diagrams; Sequential Diagrams; and Ad-hoc Diagrams. For each type of representation specific examples and uses are provided, showing the benefits and contexts in which they are used. Text-based representations are common in the real teachers' practice, while graphical representations have been taken from research initiatives. The goal of the paper is to attract attention to the fact that no type of representation for learning designs has been adopted as a mainstream, yet. A common language in this domain would be desirable and could offer great benefits related to the communication and sharing of teaching and learning results. This could be very useful for the representation of learning designs and teaching practices in learning analytics dashboards."

Recently, some initiatives have highlighted the importance of considering this uncertainty from the conceptual model to the final phases of implementation of software tools. Although the conceptual proposals for handling data uncertainty in the humanities have proliferated successfully, there is still a gap in bringing these proposals to actual implementations of software systems, especially due to the need to quantify this uncertainty and adopt more analytical paradigms based on margins of error, away from the conceptualization of data in the humanities. Trying to close this gap and avoid these paradigms, this paper presents a framework based on fuzzy logic that implements aspects of epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty related to our knowledge about the object of study) in digital humanities, providing algebraic and computational support to implementation. The framework proposes a solution to implement software systems that manage epistemic uncertainty, allowing comparisons, aggregations or reasoning with various levels of uncertainty in humanistic data. The solution is implemented in a real digital humanities project, illustrating its possibilities."

The growing interest in modeling is related to students' need to understand and use mathematics in daily life and the ineffectiveness of traditional mathematics teaching to achieve success. This strategy of focusing on real-world problems and bringing them to the world of mathematics so they can be solved has evolved from the increased interest in modeling. Based on several studies, researchers say that the method of teaching mathematics to students promotes and maintains the motivation for their learning and the study of professional careers related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a literature review on mathematical modeling in the educational field. Information was obtained about authors with the greatest number of publications on the subject, the most cited articles, the journals with the greatest number of publications, and the types of participants in the studies analyzed. Classifications of the research articles reviewed were done in accordance with the theoretical perspectives of mathematical modeling and with their purpose in mathematics education. A total of 70 articles were analyzed from which it was found that 50% of the studies start with a theoretical educational theoretical perspective; the use of modeling as a vehicle to teach Mathematics was found in 96% of the studies; the other 4% consider modeling as a purpose."

It based its investigation on the requirements of teacher professionalism in contemporary learning environments, where teachers are expected to develop the required proficiency for effectively integrating technology, pedagogy and content knowledge into their teaching so as to meet the educational needs of 21st century learners. In doing so, the research undertook this study by investigating pre-service teachers' perceptions and proficiency of ICT integration in education from the perspective of Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK). Results from analysis of pre-service teachers' basic ICT skills, attitudes towards ICT, competencies in ICT, perceptions on ICT for teaching and learning, revealed that they possess satisfactory levels of strengths in these areas of technological knowledge and skills. On the other hand, results from analysis of pre-service teachers' experiences and purpose of using ICT and ICT related support received from their institutions and teacher-educators indicate low level of readiness in integrating technology into teaching and learning. These results indicate that teacher educators and teacher education institutions have lagged behind in providing the required support, clearly revealing a gap between the educational needs of the 21st century generation of pre-service teachers and the educational provision of teacher education programs. This calls for a systemic approach to the process of integrating ICTs into teacher education and development programs in Eritrea."

This is why the Early Childhood Education stage is decisive in linguistic development and also the reason why it is necessary to count on the most adequate conditions to ensure that it evolves properly. One of the most important and most used resources at this stage is the children's literature, which has incorporated an interesting variant in recent years: new technological support. Taking this into account, a longitudinal evaluation of an experimental program based on the curricular integration of children's stories and tales mediated by technology in Early Childhood Education will be carried out, which is developed in the PhD program ""Education in the Knowledge Society"" in order to verify its positive effects and its effectiveness on the development of oral language at this early stage compared to those who have not received such stimulation."

The erruption of ICT in the schools are transforming teaching worldwide and expanding new ways for learning. However, there are also difficulties to be overcome by teachers that mostly arise at the level of integration with diverse signature pedagogies (not at the level of adoption or application). Furthermore, reaching the level of innovation with ICT is still nowadays not mainstream in education. In this regard, the multiple research evidence provided in this track from diverse contexts would lead to understanding which document the benefits of these changes but also the more constraining limitations to face."

Although they enable users to reach useful insights and support their decision-making challenges, a good design process is essential to obtain powerful tools. Users need to be part of these design processes, as they will be the consumers of the information displayed. But users are very diverse and can have different goals, beliefs, preferences, etc., and creating a new dashboard for each potential user is not viable. There exist several tools that allow users to configure their displays without requiring programming skills. However, users might not exactly know what they want to visualize or explore, also becoming the configuration process a tedious task. This research project aims to explore the automatic generation of user interfaces for supporting these decision-making processes. To tackle these challenges, a domain engineering, and machine learning approach is taken. The main goal is to automatize the design process of dashboards by learning from the context, including the end-users and the target data to be displayed."

How can digital learning strategies and interventions help shape and raise awareness about sustainable development? And how can online tools, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) become better, more efficient and even more successful in reaching out to the general audience? In hopes of finding the answers to these questions, the present dissertation is of exploratory scope with mixed design, using both quantitative and qualitative approaches to hear the voice of the users and receive feedback on these questions. A pre-post survey was applied in Rive MOOCs relevant to the theme of sustainable development during the period of January 2019 to June of the same year. As a second part of the study, interviews are taking place with users who have both completed and abandoned the MOOC, in order to compare and contrast the opinion, perspective and advice these participants would provide for future MOOCs that would be designed to teach about sustainable development. So far, the progress achieved during this research shows that users would rather hear about real life cases rather than only theory, and that they would appreciate the involvement of more interactive and social media usage for the activities inside the course in order to share with their contacts how they are learning about sustainable development."

With this conjuncture, the attitudes of Western citizens towards migration seem to be becoming increasingly hostile, at the same time that anti-immigration policies are growing. For this reason, it is important to know which are the variables that can directly or indirectly affect these attitudes, and one of the most important could be the information coverage.The intention of this doctoral research is to know exactly how refugees and migrants are being represented through frames both in the main news media of Western Europe, and in social media such as Twitter. Having knowledge about that representation and the most commonly used frames, we will try to verify what are the real effects that repeated consumption causes to these specific frameworks, on the attitudes of Western citizens about migration and refuge. What is intended with this doctoral dissertation is to be able to extract knowledge about how a specific treatment of news, events and actors related to the migration crisis can affect, in order to make recommendations based on empirical evidence so that those responsible for media and/or politics can make ethical decisions, or even promote campaigns based on the frames that increase the most supportive or benevolent attitudes toward migration."

Evaluation in a Higher Education context implies both the assessment and the grading of the work students have done. However, defining a good evaluation process is a hard task what motivates that many times the formative aspect of the evaluation is disregarded and only the grading is taken into account. In this paper, we present a methodology to help teachers define appropriate formative evaluation processes and a tool to support following the methodology. The methodology has been used during one academic year to define the evaluation of four courses. The obtained results have been very positive and it encourages us to continue applying the methodology in new courses and with more teachers."

The rapid increase in global temperatures during the last century due to an exponential increase of greenhouse gas concentrations is altering the climate beyond our capacity of adaptation. In order to mobilize the society towards bold, informed, coherent responses, public institutions should work together to raise awareness of the problem. The University must have a leading role in Climate Change communication, education and research in order to improve our capacity for Climate Change mitigation and adaptation. Climate Change is a complex problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach.In this paper we discuss the role of the university in front of this planetary issue. We discuss the challenges and opportunities that the university has as a source of knowledge through research but also as educators of a new generation that will be left to deal with this issue. At the University of Salamanca, we have launched a series of seminars titled ""The University facing the challenges of Climate Change"". This initiative aimed to create a dialogue involving multiple parties (academics, local community and the general public) as a way to exchange ideas and look for possible strategies to tackle Climate Change. The format of the seminar, including a face to face discussion between the parties and a virtual platform (Youtube channel), enhances the impact of our initiative. Additionally, the usage of digital media for Climate Change education and communication is discussed. Due to the widespread lack of materials in Spanish, this seminar, up to date and in an accessible format, is a powerful tool for Climate Change communication and education."

Many of the proposed methods are based on the concept of remote medicine or 'telemedicine', a concept that encompasses a collection of techniques based on the remote care and assistance to patients through the utilization of networks and mobile devices. In this context, the current work presents the proposal and development of a methodology for the remote detection and prevention of potential hypoxemic cases in patients susceptible to respiratory diseases. Such methodology makes use of an expert system capable of generating alerts about the degree of hypoxemia of a patient, from a data set coming from both physical measurements and professional considerations. Protocols are defined for the data collection and its treatment using mobile terminals with sensors connected to them. Additionally, the collected data is stored and processed by fuzzy-logic inference systems as a support to the decision process that is the previous step to the generation of the final alert, named 'Global Hypoxemic Risk'. This new methodology has been tested experimentally and the results have been positive, resulting in a substantial reduction in the time for the detection of the oxygen deficit, and in its further treatment and prevention of physiological consequences."

The writing of the FDP technical report tends to be one of the hurdles. Due to their inexperience, students fail to meet quality standards in their writing efforts. Research shows that text and image plagiarism, poor literature searches and lack of synthesis are some of the most usual errors. Yet, these error-filled memories keep publishing in university-backed open repositories. This paper describes a solution to help both students and supervisors detecting basic quality errors in FDP reports. Based on a chatbot front-end called Ikastenbot, students can upload their reports while they are writing them and spot, before publication, possible errors in spelling and grammar, text and images reuse, and lack of proper referencing. We applied the techniques described on the memories of our university FDP repository. Results show that Ikastenbot is able to detect errors in almost every report. The source code of our solution has been published under an open-source license."

A new wave in visualization research, uncertainty visualization, focuses on the display and conveyance of the uncertainty present in a great variety of statistical and algorithmic methods driving computations in a wide range of scientific domains. In this paper, we present a visualization dashboard concept in which we introduced uncertainty induced by a simple linguistic algorithm that is commonly employed in humanities research. According to this new paradigm, we showcase how accessible pre-existing visualizations, such as 2D histograms, can be easily adapted to communicate inherent algorithmic variability to the user, motivating uncertainty-aware research analyses in a DH context."

In particular, the gender gap is pronounced in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields at all levels of education and labour market. In those areas, the women participation remains low, although there are differences from country to country. In the Latin American context, there is a need for carrying out studies to collect quality data about the actual situation of women in STEM. Although some available data show a high proportion of women in Latin American university education, they are a minority in STEM programs. Moreover, this problem is particularly severe in Latin America because of the biases or cultural norms that influence female behaviour. In this context, the W-STEM project seeks to improve strategies and mechanisms for attracting, accessing, and guiding women in Latin America in STEM higher education programs. This work aims to describe the main results to prepare a set of attraction campaigns in secondary schools in the Latin American countries involved in the project (Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico). In particular, a self-assessment tool about gender equality in higher education institutions in Latin America, an interview protocol for female role models, and a mobile application to show those role models."

It was aimed to reveal trends and new potential solutions to be explored in the teaching of mathematics. We carefully selected sixty-four papers related with the objective above cited. From which we inspected twenty-four discovering that abstraction is a key skill for mathematics and Computational Thinking. We also discovered that we need to define which type of abstraction are we going to work on together with choosing between the two ways of teaching CT: integrating it to the curricula or as an after-school program.

They have applications in such different areas as Meteorology, Cybersecurity, Biology, etc.; though their use in these areas is not so extended. High-performance Computing (HPC) is the most powerful solution to get the best results by using these algorithms. HPC requires various skills to use, such as parallel programming and shell scripting on linux system which may require a long time to acquire and might be intimidating for research with small or no background in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) such as meteorologists or biologists. This work intends to encourage the use of HPC techniques among non-ICT researchers. In order to do so, we plan to analyze the response of such researchers when they are presented some new techniques and possibilities. A set of experiments are being carried out with a group of ethology researchers at E\""{o}tv\""{o}s Lor\'{a}nd University. We will use a three-step methodology. First, researchers will fill out a questionnaire about their knowledge about and attitude towards HPC techniques. Then, they will attend an introductory talk about HPC in general and some specific use cases which may aid them in their research, after which they will receive a follow up questionnaire. After this a subset of the attendees will receive hands-on training in the use of specific HPC applications. Finally, a last round of questionnaires will be carried out with the participants. We expect to identify some key indicators which allow us to identify the main advantages and drawbacks that non-ICT researchers face when discovering High-performance Computing."
2019,"Classroom study on school effectiveness in Baja California, Mexico","Caso-L\'{o}pez, Alicia Alel\'{\i} Chaparro and Mac\'{\i}as, Juan Carlos Rodr\'{\i}guez and G\'{o}mez-Monarrez, C\'{e}sar",10.1145/3362789.3362862,https://doi.org/10.1145/3362789.3362862,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"This document presents a research study carried out in Baja California, Mexico: its objective was to execute a multiple case study to analyze effective and ineffective schools, particularly with regard to what happens inside the classrooms. Six schools were included in the study: 2 highly effective schools and 4 schools with low levels of effectiveness; which were selected from a previous study in which using multilevel techniques and considering the level of achievement and a series of contextual variables, high and low schools were identified as waste, or high and low efficiency schools. The reported case study compromised 8 evaluations aimed at managers, teachers and students. Using the aforementioned instruments, we were able to collect information through both qualitative and quantitative tools. Based on the obtained results, many of the identified practices converge at the findings of the literature on school effectiveness. The importance of student-teacher interaction and teaching practices in educational achievement is confirmed."

Plenty of these have been developed from the Effective Teaching line of research, which has evolved along with the political, technological and social conditions of students and educational actors. Constant change is the main rival for teachers, this propitiates that the teaching practices that work, cease to be useful, rather than those that did not work, begin to favor learning; and others are reaffirmed over time. The objective of this study was to identify effective teaching practices reported in empirical studies in this century, through revision, coding and classification, based on the Danielson framework, expanded by Guti\'{e}rrez-Anguiano [1]. The main inputs obtained were the recognition of the predominance of quantitative methodology, the abundant study in higher education, the hegemonic study in America, the exponential development of 2000 to present days, the overcoming of the diffusion in the English language versus Spanish, and the supremacy of classroom teaching and climate dimensions versus planning and preparation, professional responsibilities and the evaluation of teacher learning."

This paper addresses the first path of this process by using manual and computational methods to analyze the complete stream of Twitter messages in Spanish referring the boat Aquarius (N = 24,254) From the rejection of Italy, until the arrival at the Spanish port of Valencia, which was a milestone for the entry of refugees and was highly covered by the media. We found that most of the messages revolved around few topics and were mostly positive, but a significant part of negative messages included hate speech towards refugees and rejection of politicians. Supporting our hypothesis, online hate speech grew after the announcement. The general positive sentiment paradoxically increased, and the language sentiment became less negative. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications, and acknowledge limitations referred to the examined timeframe, suggesting more longitudinal analyses."

In order to exemplify the research process from the methodological complementarity, a contextualized study was carried out in the city of Valladolid (Spain) through a mixed approach with the objective of identifying the socio-labour actions implemented by third sector entities that work with people at risk and socially excluded, including women. For this purpose, semi-structured interviews were conducted with workers from the participating entities, and information was also collected in other formats such as roadmaps and reports from the centres. From the categorization, the codification of the speeches and the results of the quantitative scales we proceeded to the triangulation of the data, with the support of digital supports, CAQDAS. Nvivo 12 and webQDA were used. The node map, project map, coding matrices, dendrogram, word trees and word clouds were made. This made it possible to respond to the objective and the research question, concluding that each entity developed different degrees of socio-labour attention based on its degree of available resources. The study was an example of the representation of reality from the convergence of the quantitative perspective and the qualitative perspective."

They are used so that students learn practical competences, and to support their development of an applied critical thinking. Particularly, when it comes to a distance methodology, the employment of these tools is very relevant, since students are not face-to-face in classroom. In this sense, the use of Learning Analytics (LA) techniques becomes even more essential for improving the learning/teaching process. This work focuses on the proposal and analysis of a container-based virtual laboratory for cybersecurity activities, from the point of view of the students' behavior and their outcomes. In addition to this, the factors that influence the students' acceptance in the subject are analyzed. The study has been comparatively performed with a previous academic year."

Data were collected through naturalistic non-participant classroom observation and semi-structured interviews with the teacher and five students involved in an innovative academic practice in an undergraduate Biology course. Results show that the written feedback provided in this case increased opportunities for students to search for further information, to negotiate and take decisions within their group, to co-construct their own feedback before sending their final critical analyses to the teacher. Their group work also allowed them to develop critical thinking, collaboration and argumentation. Our study adds two specific innovative contributions to these discussions, to (i) invoke the active engagement of students in the provision of 'co-constructed' feedback within their undergraduate studies, and (ii) to focus specifically on developing students' critical thinking."

It is inferred that by using technology, an architecture student can perform their projects in a way that adjust the way of learning to their profile and to the current tendency of visualization. An analysis of the characteristics of the contemporary students' profile is made along with how traditional methods that can be supported with technology specifically with immerse virtual systems. It is demonstrated in this article how gamified strategies for the understanding of three-dimensional space improve spatial competences of students generating greater motivation in their use and it ease for understanding the space and making decisions. The data is obtained from the quantitative assessment, to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual systems on the design of urban environments. This lets us identify specific features in an objective way. The findings show that the use of Virtual Reality helps to increase the digital competences in complex representation and permit assessment and decision-making in the processes of urban design spaces. The relevance of this study is the redefinition of the studies of the design processes in Architecture studies in relation to the adaptation of teaching methodologies to the profile of today's students."

It is even more so in the knowledge-intensive institutions like in higher education. Its proper management incorporates three main components, namely People, Technology and Process. It is the coherence between these main components that determines the success of a Knowledge Management System (KMS). Since the later years of last decade, the advancement in the features of technology hardware and their functionalities have brought more focus on the technology capabilities to serve the human resource beyond representing and processing information. Moreover, the growing digital-native generation also forms the basis for the application of advancing features of technology into the processes to efficiently utilize the knowledge resources for greater educational and research endeavors towards sustainability of higher education. This Systematic Literature review, therefore, describes the methodology developed to conduct the review and provides analysis of the findings exploring the trend in the application of information technologies in higher education KMS. It will also identify gaps where more research needed and describing lessons acquired for contextual application of KMS in developing countries' higher education."

It incorporates virtual exchange activities carried in English, which allow to improve a large number of soft skills developed thanks to the ABP combination with intercultural interaction. This aims at increasing the motivation of the students, and improving their communicative capacity in English. This proposal will also involve strengthening their teamwork skills, and using new technologies that are basic to enable communication between team members in two different countries. Other skills will also be developed, such as better time management, individual responsibility in the tasks assigned and improved communication for non-experts, since the work has been developed with students of different degrees. Finally, this proposal will be completed by peer assessment making them more aware of their ability and their performance in the tasks."
2023,L@S '23: Proceedings of the Tenth ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,"It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Tenth Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2023, held July 20-22, 2023, in Copenhagen, Denmark.The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) created the conference, inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. During the last few years, new opportunities for scaling up learning have emerged, like hybrid learning environments combining online and face-to-face, informal learning enabled by all sorts of platforms (e.g., gamified language learning, citizen science communities, and collaborative programming communities), or new ways of learning supported by recent advances in artificial intelligence. L@S has evolved along with these emergent massive learning scenarios and opportunities and is today one of the most prominent venues for discussion of the highest quality research on how learning and teaching can be transformed at scale, in diverse learning environments.L@S examines learning and teaching processes in all large-scale, technology-mediated learning environments that typically have many active learners and few experts to guide their learning progress or respond to individual needs in time. Research on learning at scale involves the examination of learning and teaching processes, based on the diverse types of data and technology-mediated environments, with a particular purpose of increasing human potential, leveraging data collection, data analysis, human interaction, and varying forms of computational and other types of assessment, adaptation, and guidance. Dealing with data and humans in the context of education requires a systemic approach considering organizational, technical, and social factors as well as factors related to fairness, accountability, trustworthiness, culture and equity, which are increasingly included as major research topics in the L@S community.,As the complexity of data and learning settings evolves, the learning at scale research also expands, becoming more interdisciplinary, multifaceted, and advanced. As a community, we aim for novel methods and approaches to measure learning more directly, accompanied by generalizable insight around instructional techniques, learning habits and behavior change, technological infrastructures, and experimental interventions aiming at improving learning outcomes. Creating new methods and measures is only possible with an interdisciplinary community that brings together learning scientists with computer and data specialists.The theme of L@S 2023 is Learning Futures@Scale. The widespread move to online learning during the last few years due to the global pandemic has opened new opportunities and challenges for the L@S community. These opportunities and challenges relate not only to the educational technologies used but also to the social, organizational, and contextual aspects of supporting learners and educators in these dynamic and, nowadays, often multicultural learning environments. How the future of learning at scale will look needs careful consideration from several points of view, including a focus on technological, social, organizational, cultural, and responsible aspects of learning and teaching."

This learning beyond a specific spatial setting allows students to develop their knowledge and acquire information in the digital environment through different channels. In this regard, virtual communities where students participate in formal and informal contexts gain special significance, which favors the development of relationships where intercultural understanding plays a relevant role.Participation in virtual communities or digital contexts where potential intercultural citizenship becomes a reality requires that teachers and students have an adequate level of digital and informational competence. These competences are essential both at the social and at the education levels, since they are basic tools for fostering participation and inclusion in society, as well as equal opportunities.On these grounds, this paper first approaches intercultural competence as a key aspect for students to become aware as citizens of the potential of intercultural relations as a source for enrichment, to subsequently review a series of definitions of digital and informational competence and what their acquisition involves in terms of learning outcomes. Finally, this theoretical approach will be concluded by focusing on the analysis of the aspects that might be taken into account for the development of intercultural competence through digital and informational competences acquired through the use of ICT."

In this sense, previous research has demonstrated the importance of identification with the characters as one of the fundamental mechanisms of narrative persuasion. However, the study of the factors that increase the identification with the characters of a narrative message is still scarce.The present project will specifically focus on the role of two independent variables that can increase identification and indirectly influence intergroup attitudes: the narrator point of view and the similarity between the character and the audience of the message. To this end, two experimental studies will be conducted, using narratives (written and audiovisual) in which the protagonist will be a stigmatized immigrant (Moroccan immigrant). Both studies will contrast the effect of the narrator point of view and the similarity between the character and audience, on the identification with the character and the attitudes toward immigration."

Consequently ethno-pedagogy - teaching and learning that fosters intra and inter-cultural understandings, values, attitudes and skills-is needed. Indonesia University of Education (UPI) is committed to fostering ethno-pedagogy paradigms and exploring tools and developing strategies towards this aim. Research shows that social media tools facilitate growth of ethno-pedagogic perspectives by supporting integration of self with membership in a multi-cultural community. Accordingly social media tools were put to use to facilitate students to be reflective of their experience of learning activities of the 'UPI Cultural Market'. This paper provides a glimpse into exploratory activities used to harness social media tools to the field of ethno-pedagogy. Student posts showed growing ethno-pedagogic perspectives with peripheral community engagement. Further harnessing of social media could strengthen efforts to utilise this arena for visible communication and meaning making. Doing so would support embodiment of unity in diversity, leading to equitable, inclusive schooling and community engagement."

To contribute for sustainable solutions in education, the use of remote laboratories instead of the traditional hands-on laboratories should be considered in every engineering course. It is precisely this aspect that is discussed in the current paper. Some comments about the importance of sustainability in education are made. Later, it is described the use of a remote laboratory named VISIR in a course held at the Polytechnic of Porto -- School of Engineering, for the conduction of an electronic experiment named Schmitt Trigger. At the end, some comments about the contribution of this remote lab for sustainability in education, are provided."

These three dimensions are interrelated and interconnected in such a way that it is sometimes very hard to discriminate what their individual effects are, or on the contrary, how their joint effects are synergistic. And if this is generically a difficult task, when it comes to education the difficulty becomes even more significant, as one must be very careful defining concepts in an absolutely clear and undoubtful way. While the specialization is required to educate professionals able to accurately project and build these projects, it is now mandatory that everyone is also able to understand the causes and effects of their actions, towards sustainable development.In this Track, different teaching &amp; learning approaches have been presented and discussed, aiming to use Higher Education as a highway to educate the professionals of the near future as strategic partners for the development of different mindsets, able to tackle the real problems."

The concept of energy literacy aggregates three main dimensions: energy-related knowledge, attitude and behavior. Although knowledge alone may not be synonymous of a good level of energy literacy, it is one of the cornerstones. As a rule, much of the knowledge we have is acquired in schools, and although in the early years some focus is given to some basic notions of energy, these prove to be insufficient. In this way, more specific energy-related knowledge can be acquired later in higher education. However, not all higher education courses include in their curriculum, units that meet this need. Thus, in this paper we intend to evaluate how the education field influences the levels of energy literacy. Statistically and in empirical terms, we found that the levels of energy literacy are moderate, but we did not find significant differences between the different education fields analyzed. The reasons for the findings are discussed and we provide some suggestions for the future of education."

The research has characteristics of a mixed study, qualitative predominant method (Cuanti + CUALI). Through a quantitative methodology, instruments of measurement of the aforementioned competences will be applied and statistical analysis will be carried out. Through the qualitative methodology, the development process of the aforementioned skills will be analyzed from each student's individual self-records and the argumentative discussions of the student teams. The original study corresponding to the Doctoral Thesis used a sample of 250 students distributed in 6 courses who study the subject, ICT in Education from the Education Department of the University of Salamanca. However, for the purposes of this paper, the results of a single course consisting of 56 students will be presented. The main results are the characterization of the sample in terms of their argumentative, motivational and learning strategies, showing an average level reached. Likewise, it was possible to carry out within the framework of a curriculum subject to pedagogical activity supported by software and oriented towards the development of argumentative and metacognitive skills."

This study seeks to analyse the initial and ongoing training of teachers in both stages in different European countries. The methodology used was a documentary analysis, analysing ten countries of the European Union. The results with respect to initial teacher training show that the level of training in most countries is the same in ECE and PE. However, there are differences in the years of training duration at both stages and between the different countries. In the case of lifelong learning, it is compulsory in only four countries. Incentives vary locally in the Nordic countries. Southern EU countries receive incentives such as time compensation, promotion options or transfer points (mobility). On the other hand, there are those countries that do not make training compulsory but reward it.In conclusion, among teachers there is no equal level of training between countries. Neither does it exist in the same duration for the same studies. The most common thing is that within the same country the same level of training is given between the two stages, in those countries in which it is not equal. PE always means more years of training. Therefore, the level of initial teacher training in each country is not related to belonging to IE or PE. Lifelong learning is not usually compulsory in the EU, but there is usually an incentive."

But which society layers are being involved in the process of conceiving AIEd scope and what kind of debates are gaining traction in terms of AIEd potential, concerns, implications and contextual meaning? And, finally, what are the frameworks being considered in terms of the ethical challenges posed to the experience of learning itself? Committed with this context, this research will focus the ethical challenges of AI, in what concerns the signification of a learning experience in formal education, regarding the capacity to collect sense from content and stimuli. The Cultural-Historical Activity Theory will give the proper background to the understanding of the learning experience through the lens of control and agency. Throughout the research it will be explored if and how ethical impact assessment of AIEd (1) influences primary teachers' capacity to design learning sequences that intentionally and systematically address the challenges AI poses to learning signification processes, (2) benefiting students' critical thinking upon AI. A comprehensive socio-constructivist approach to an eLearning course is expected to contribute to teachers' capacity to intentionally explore the potential and limits of using AI in their systematic pedagogical action for the holistic development of their students."

The main objective is to identify the typology of symbolic frames that are most frequently transmitted in Western European media during the Mediterranean migration crisis, as well as the elements and attributes of denotative and stylistic nature that make up each of these frames. To this end, content analysis has been used as a methodological frame. The resulting findings offer a global vision of the visual treatment that the main European media are doing about the crisis, and how they mainly represent refugees and migrants. The analysis focuses on the four main and major news frames on displaced persons: normalization, victimization, burden and threat. The findings indicate that a typology of visual frames that represent the refugee and/or migrant as a victim, sufferer and in need, predominates in all media and countries. However, it has been found that the two frames of the most negative tendency, those that represent those subjects as a possible burden and/or threat to Western societies, surpass the other two frames in frequency. On the other hand, the denotative elements that contain each one of the symbolic frames are compared to know how they are constructed or what attributes conform in a specific way a type of framing or representation. In this regard, it has been found that displaced children and women tend to appear more frequently in normalization and victimization frames, while men and young people or adults appear more frequently in the burden and threat frames, usually in large groups of people that seems to be a mass, and showing religious elements and symbols."

In countries that have a more developed scientific culture, public support for major science is usually found and this favors governments having a more positive attitude towards the need to devote resources to research and development. Without science society does not advance, innovation must be applied to all the pillars of society. In this context, the actors involved in the scientific sector have a fundamental role in the development of the science of the future.The question that is launched is: where does science go in Portugal? What are the main concerns of each individual person within their own context? The opinion of representative profiles of the whole sector is collected: specialized journalists, editors of scientific journals, researchers and teachers, and doctoral students who join the academy. The created content will show a story that is built through personal opinions in interviews, video, podcast and social networks integrating into the project website.As expected results, it is desired to give visibility to the importance of reflecting on the whole of the science sector to face the future with positive perspectives that involve all profiles. The points in common are sought, the map of the great issues that generate concern and the divergences between all the actors that show us a way forward."

However, developing parallel programs to take advantage of its benefits, making a proper and effective use of the available computing resources, can be a difficult task for beginners or scientists of specific branches of science which have very little to do with computer programming. For this purpose, a transcompiler for automatic parallelization of sequential codes was developed to train beginners in parallel programming and achieve better performances in HPC centers. Current efforts are focused on expanding the transcompiler with an additional module for optimizing sequential and parallel code fragments with the objective of speeding up their execution times. To accomplish this, several techniques for writing efficient code have been evaluated with a view to integrate them into the transcompiler in the future. This manuscript discusses the importance of these techniques to decrease running times of HPC programs. In addition, a set of tests have been developed for analysing and measuring the improvements achieved when applying each of these techniques, all of them with a significant impact on the execution times."

The main objective is to analyze the factors that can increase the effectiveness of narrative interventions for smoking prevention aimed at adults. Three experimental investigations will be carried out. The first two experiments will have a 2 (narrative voice in first vs. third person) by 2 (similarity with the protagonist in behavioral terms) factorial design. For this, four written narratives will be developed for each experiment on ex-smokers and will be distributed randomly through Qualtrics. The third experiment will consist in the development and validation of a mobile application to stop smoking, taking the results of this project as a reference. In the first experiment we observed that the optimal reception condition increased the identification with the protagonist, and this produced grater cognitive elaboration, expectations of self-efficacy and perception of the effectiveness of the preventive response, causing more intention to stop smoking. However, the optimal reception condition did not increase the narrative transport, therefore, indirect, direct or total effects were not observed."

The aim of this study is to investigate the reliability of infrared thermography (IRT) in monitoring the quality of resuscitative breaths in undergraduate nursing students during a simulated CPR-based clinical practice. We recruited a convenience sample of 21 volunteer students in the second year of the Bachelor of Nursing. Participants were instructed to perform CPR following the European Resuscitation Council guidelines in training manikins from Laerdal Medical® during two consecutive minutes. Demographic and knowledge data about CPR performance were collected with a questionnaire whilst ventilation quality parameters (volume, rate, time spent) were provided by the manikin software. Thermographic images from the manikin's peripheral mouth region were recorded at the end of each CPR ventilation cycle. The temperature profile was examined at baseline and after 1 and 2 minutes of ventilation performance. A temperture increment of 1.357 ºC was observed when comparing the maximum temperature at minute 1 with regard to baseline, whilst a significative decrease was obtained between minute 1 and minute 2 (0.457ºC) of the study. The comparison between the number of ventilations and the temperature variation after 1 minute of CPR training produced good correlation values (rho = 0.658, p=0.0019). A positive association was also observed between IRT and t ventilation volume values (r = 0.503, p=0.02). Our results indicate that infrared thermography is a promising tool for assessing ventilation performance in CPR practice, thus enabling its potential use as predictor of the quality of resuscitative breaths in simulation-based scenarios."

The aim of this article is to outline the state-of-the-art in Learning Design, covering the period from 2001 to 2018. We analyzed the quality, coverage of topics, research methodologies adopted and the potential impact of LD. We carried out manual and automatic research for Systematic Literature Review (SLR) published in journals and conference proceedings. We investigated the relevant studies, compared and integrated our results with the two previous higher education studies. Therefore, 67 articles were identified, which we classified in two main areas of research: a) The use of the specification and its standards; b) The development of systems of authorship, management and execution of LD. From these 67, only 8 achieved the minimum quality requirements established and were considered relevant for the scenario of this research. Finally, our results allow us to see that the SLR as a research method has been less adopt in the LD research community. Additionally, most SLRs did not assess the quality of primary studies, thus restricting their potential impact on educational practice."

The results demonstrate that, while the availability and excessive use of ICTs, both in the educational environment and in the home, are factors associated with low effectiveness, other more personal characteristics of the pupils, such as their perception of self-efficacy in the management of ICT, or their own interest in the use of technologies, can be considered as factors in the protection of school effectiveness. We conclude by discussing the relationship between school effectiveness and academic performance through the analysis of previous studies, focusing on the common elements detected within both perspectives."

This means that one of the major challenges of the governments are the citizens' acceptance to the e-Government systems and having interest in using the services, because people do not have the strong bond of trust when it comes to online technologies because of fear of security breaches [6]. Even Dubai, which is considered as a multicultural city, finds this enigma challenging [7]. Hence, this paper discusses about the E-Government Frameworks proposed by authors which is more citizen centric and touch upon the issues as well as the success factors about E-Governance (Government2Citizen) aspects. Also a tailored framework is derived from the discovered factors which will be discussed over Dubai's case as being a smart government. Finally, some G2C industry solutions will be displayed and compared in a table for the various features each vendor offers in the today's market."
2018,Utilizing technological ecosystems to support graduate students in their practicum experiences,"Tinoco-Giraldo, Harold and S\'{a}nchez, Eva Mar\'{\i}a Torrecilla and Garc\'{\i}a-Pe\~{n}alvo, Francisco Jos\'{e}",10.1145/3284179.3284344,https://doi.org/10.1145/3284179.3284344,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"This article (which form part of a doctoral thesis) explores mentoring that uses 21st century technologies and its implications for learning. The paper outlines how mentoring, enabled by technology, supports the growth of students and their social, academic and practical dimensions through the creation of informal partnerships with mentors. Additionally, it describes how online mentoring assists learners on their path towards an academic practicum semester and which components of online mentoring they need to apply. Given this educational and social context, a mentoring program may improve the skills of future professionals in the field of marketing by improving and stimulating the acquisition of transversal competencies with the support of other specialists and students in the same field of training. The program is intended for students of the fifth and sixth semester of the Marketing Program of the University of Manizales (Colombia). To do this, we propose a pre-post, quasi-experimental study linking different instruments for collection of information using quantitative and qualitative methods. Furthermore, this ongoing mentoring program in its various forms is attractive to the educational field as well as to corporate businesses that have acknowledged the potential import and efficiency of online mentoring programs. When the study is applied, its characteristics, responsibilities and practices will be also discussed, highlighting the analysis, design, development and evaluation to improve the process."

This is an obstacle for retrieval techniques as well as for geospatial disciplines. Main point is, that established standards cannot handle uncertainty of geospatial information or are the source for uncertainty. We recommend a new concept to store and handle geo-information as metadata for historical photographs. The approach presented in this paper suggests how to source the necessary information and deal with uncertainty using Volunteered Geographic Information concepts."

Unlike traditional video recordings, which usually provide a very restrictive perspective of an object, person or environment, 360° videos provide users with full spherical views. In this paper, the authors share their recent experience with the design and implementation of a 360° video application. The application provides foreign language learners with an immersive learning environment that allows them to interact with the environment and its content, while practicing, at the same time, different language skills. The purpose of the study is to explore the possibilities of 360° video applications and chatbots for creating immersive environments in which language learners can foster their language competencies by means of real world-like situations."

To implement video games effectively, it is important to make good video game selections and to consider certain criteria. One of these criteria is the video game content rating system: in Europe, the Pan European Game Information system (PEGI). We focus on this topic as one of the content and activity areas of a teacher training programme about video games and education for pre-service primary school teachers. In this paper, we explore the pre-service primary school teachers' perceptions of their knowledge about the PEGI rating system before and after the training programme, considering, on one hand, the complete sample and, on the other, the participants' gender and prior training in video games as an educational resource. Furthermore, we determine whether there were statistical differences in the teachers' perceptions of knowledge about PEGI before and after the training programme: that is, between the pretest and the posttest. The results indicate differences between before and after the training programme, showing that the teacher training programme and its activities increased the participants' perceptions of knowledge about PEGI. Thus, we can say that the programme was successful in this respect. Finally, we present some limitations of the study that should be considered in further research."

Intensive experimental research conducted on dental tribology allows to develop a more detailed understanding of all the phenomena that take part in the phenomenon of tooth wear. The purpose of this work is to investigate tribological performances in the tooth-to-tooth contact and material-to-natural tooth contact (zirconia vs. zirconia and natural tooth vs. zirconia). The tribological tests were carried out by using a reciprocating tribometer under lubricated conditions (artificial saliva). The normal force in these tests was 20 N, and the duration was of 60 min. The stroke length was 2 mm, according to the range of displacement used in scientific literature. The wear mass loss evaluation was evaluated by using a gravimetric method. A topographic analysis was carried with a 3D non-contact optical profiler in order to characterize the wear mechanisms present in the worn surfaces after each of tribo-tests. The results show that the minimum value of the COF is obtained in the case of Zirconia vs. Zirconia tribo-couple, corresponding to 0.49±0.03. In the case of the tooth-tooth couple this value is 0.52 ±0.03. The results on the wear mass loss show a very low wear rate when coupling in tribological condition natural tooth with a ceramic restoration (a mean value of 0.5 mg was found). This rate is even lower when the contact is between two artificial zirconia teeth."

In order to do so, we have built a Machine Learning model to predict student results in a specific practical assignment of the Ampliati\'{o}n de Sistemas Operativos subject, from the second course of the degree in Computer Science of the University of Le\'{o}n, through their interaction with a Git repository. To build the model, several classifiers and predictors have been evaluated. In order to do so, we have developed Model Evaluator (MoEv), a tool to evaluate different Machine Learning models in order to get the most suitable for a specific problem. Prior to the model development, a feature selection of the input data is done. The resulting model has been trained using results from 2016--2017 course and later validated using results from 2017--2018 course. Results conclude that the model predict students' success with a success high percentage."

However, the recent developments around the diversity of web communication channels triggered the scientific community to start questioning the legitimacy of these metrics as the sole indicators of impact. In this context, alternative metrics based on web indicators have begun to emerge. This study attempts to determine the existence of a correlation between traditional citations and altmetric mentions, while also considering if the type of access --- open or restricted --- has an influence in the impact of a publication. The study is based on a mixed methodology. The sample was composed by the most cited hot papers extracted from the Web of Science, and the most mentioned papers in Altmetrics, between 2016 and 2018, according to type of access. Their numbers in altmetrics and in reference databases (Web of Science and Scopus) was collected and the data was analyzed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. It is concluded that there is not a significant correlation between citations and altmetrics mentions, and that the type of access is not relevant for a paper's success."

However, it is perceived that students of classical languages could face bigger disadvantage just because of the type of studies they chose to undertake. For this reason, we ask ourselves what is the perception of students of classical disciplines regarding the use of new technologies in classrooms and what competences they consider to be developed within these studies. Using a participatory approach/vision of the world and using a qualitative case study methodology, we collect data through semi-structured interviews with Italian and Spanish students. The OpenCode program was used to analyze the data. The main content categories were: use of technological resources in the classroom, teaching methods, Latin and Greek competences useful for job placement. We have discovered that students, especially Italians, perceive a deficient use of technology in the classroom and that the use of frontal teaching prevails. In terms of competences, students hardly see the usefulness of classical languages for their future work. We offer a proposal for the evaluation of citizenship competences for students of classical languages."

The difficulties of teaching and learning programming are a cause for concern for everyone where this subject is needed. It is a universal problem. The theme of teaching and learning programming difficulties is a serious problem not only for the important concepts underlying and structuring the course, but also for the lack of motivation, the failure, and abandonment that such frustration may imply for the student. It is important to act quickly. The follow-up of each student must be immediate and personalized. It is not possible to follow a traditional system of exposing the syntax and semantics of a language, with demonstrative examples of the concept, something more is needed. It is important to make an individual and constant evaluation of all the concepts that are part of the programming course. With this constant and personalized evaluation, it is possible to build a profile of each student's competences -- building skills in introductory programming. Giving each student the opportunity to improve particular skills. This concept is very similar to the skills of a character in a computer game, which can be acquired through training, performing tasks or practicing a certain ability. The paper goal is to describe a system that allows us to suggest exercises and to evaluate the results automatically. That will allow to construct the profile of the student in programming, according to the different phases of learning. This set of skills allow the teacher to have complete and updated information of the students' knowledge at all times, and thus minimizes the students' demotivation and failure."

English is expected to be the lingua franca bridging the communication and integration between native speakers of different mother tongues. However, little research has been done to support this assumption. In this paper we analyzed how integrated language communities are by analyzing the scholars' tweets used in 26 Computer Science conferences over a time span of five years. We found that although English is the most popular language used to tweet during conferences, a significant proportion of people also tweet in other languages. In addition, people who tweet solely in English interact mostly within the same group (English monolinguals), while people who speak other languages interact more with different lingua groups. Finally, we also found higher interaction between people tweeting in different languages. These results suggest a relation between the number of languages a user speaks and their interaction dynamics in online communities."

In this paper we present a project called ""Superhero's Science"", carried out with a special group of Secondary School last year students, in ""Sciences Applied to Professional Activity"" subject. These scholars with learning difficulties are part of ""Programs for the Improvement of the Learning and the Performance"". Using the methodology of work in collaborative groups, this project was very useful to motivate these students in their science lessons. In addition, it improved their learning and their autonomy at class work, allowing them to learn how to do a research project, how to redact a paper, how to make graphs, and how to design posters."
2018,The Use of Heterogeneity to Improve the Learning Process of Large Groups of Students,"Fern\'{a}ndez-Guti\'{e}rrezdelalamo, Luis and Bolonio, David and Izquierdo-D\'{\i}az, Miguel and Barrio-Parra, Fernando and Mazadiego, Luis Felipe and Fidalgo-Blanco, \'{A}ngel",10.1145/3284179.3284297,https://doi.org/10.1145/3284179.3284297,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"Students start university with a high heterogeneity, both in knowledge and abilities to cope with the different subjects. Traditional teaching methods are based on unidirectional transmission of knowledge, from teachers to students, causing problems when the aforementioned heterogeneity is high. Some new methods try to homogenize the students before the start of the course. As an innovative approach, this study tries to use the heterogeneity to improve the final learning. Continuous assessment, collective intelligence and the use of web 2.0 have been applied to encourage collaboration and horizontal share of knowledge. Results show how the mixture of students with different knowledge or abilities can be effective, probably because of motivational forces that initiate in the doubts of low level students and in the incentive of high level students to teach and share their knowledge."

This is due to the fact that, until less than 20 years ago, it was necessary to dissect the brain in order to see these anatomical structures. Currently, three-dimensional images that represent the neural tracts in vivo can be obtained non-invasively through a radiological study with specific sequences of magnetic resonance and post-processing. However, ever since it was applied to the field of medicine, this sequence of magnetic resonance has been the target of criticism, because there are some limitations to tractography. One of its most important drawbacks is its interpretation: the image that is obtained and then post-processed is represented with fibers in different colors and directions. Ideally, there should be information about what those fibers correspond to, so that it can be used as training material for healthcare students. Another significant limitation is the reliability of the representation of neural tracts, because distortions in the image have been described that may be relevant, particularly in the field of neurosurgery. Our goal with this article is to describe one of the main tracts of the CNS, the corticospinal tract, also known as the pyramidal tract, and to assess interpersonal variability and carry out a detailed description of this structure in order to facilitate its interpretation for users. In addition, we will present a comparative analysis of the two software applications used to obtain three-dimensional tractographic images: a free program (3D Slicer) and a commercial program (AW Server)."

The main goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of different assessment methodologies in the final students' grades, to evaluate students' perceptions regarding these changes, and to know which teaching/learning methodologies are most effective. The study allows concluding that students prefer the traditional teaching/learning methodology and consider more beneficial for their learning the assessment through several questions/problems and small tests during the theoretical lessons instead of carrying out a single moment of evaluation and test. The majority of students were able to identify that the development of the practical work (PW) and several moments of assessment help in providing knowledge to the area under study, encourage their collaborative work and stimulate their intellectual curiosity."

The premise is that the technology used in Virtual Reality (VR), is familiar to the Architecture students, which preview to work on specific parameters and outcome, and on the contrary, citizens with a profile not related to the field get more excited and perceive the technology as a more efficient tool. To prove this, we use a quantitative method to evaluate the satisfaction of citizens related and not related to the Architecture field. Using an interactive visualization process in a real environment, we obtained adequate feedback that allowed the optimization of this type of experiment in future iterations. The results show that the degree of satisfaction when using an advanced visualization technology was satisfactory with a differentiation between user's profiles."

Software development communities, with the challenges that the vertiginous evolution of technologies and the new organizational forms of the software industry suppose, are failing to enable participation of newcomers. The lack of empirical and holistic experiences to guide managers to launch and maintain communities of practice in software development motivates this study. We are also concerned with the limited perspective with which participation is defined and measured in software development studies.The goal of the research is to design a model of participation in software development communities of practice. Specifically with this work, we aim to discuss the fundamentals sustaining the model and to present the methodology conducted to design and validate it. To obtain its first version, we conducted a methodology based on the theoretical analysis and synthesis of the related literature. In order to validate it, we designed a three-phase methodology comprising interview-based, expert-based and fuzz-cognitive-maps-based validations. By now, we have executed the interview-based study. The model that we already obtained includes contributions of other models, but it also achieves a multidimensional perspective of the phenomenon. The analysis of the interviews has enabled us to have an empirical notion of participation from different regions and workplace conditions."

A pilot study was performed in order to test the correspondence validity between the Chinese and Spanish versions of the same questionnaire. The results show that watching subtitled Spanish films and series has been preferred by the respondents, and they do it frequently. In addition, they take it as an effective way to learn Spanish. Likewise, the results indicate that the respondents are not satisfied with the current situation of the film and television market with subtitling neither in China nor in Spain. Consequently, two more further experimental studies are being developed on course. They are designed with the purpose of testing the effects of exposure to audiovisual products with different subtitling characteristics and the identification with characters in the films and TV series on the learning of the above the mentioned languages."

This new design does not emerge without difficulties or controversy; the most relevant issue is the lack of a pedagogical model adapted to their features. Two different kinds of MOOC can be distinguished; the connectivist cMOOC and the xMOOC, that is based on a learning platform built as a traditional learning classroom. If the MOOC claims to transfer or create new knowledge among the participants, it has to consider the way this knowledge is created and transferred. This paper is focused on the knowledge management made on a new MOOC, the hMOOC or hybrid MOOC that combines characteristics of the both MOOC models mentioned above. In the conclusions of this paper, it will be presented a better perception of the hMOOC participants in the use made of the knowledge management processes regarding the xMOOC."

Participants of the study are one hundred and fifty secondary school teachers from schools of Punjab state of India. Survey was used to study Teachers' attitude and beliefs towards ICT in Teaching and Learning. Semi-structured interviews were also carried out with the purpose of deepening into major motivations and beliefs of teachers. The findings show that teachers' attitude towards the use of ICT is highly positive but the use of ICT in classrooms is inadequate. Overall, the key issues and challenges that were found to influence use of ICT tools by teachers are, limited accessibility of internet connection, lack of modern infrastructure, limited technical support, lack of effective training, limited time, rigid curriculum, traditional methods of evaluation, certificates and degrees-oriented education and lack of teacher's competencies to use ICT. Moreover, the results from t - test show that there are no gender differences in use of ICT by teachers. Findings also indicate that new ways of teacher training need to be developed so that teachers make adequate use of ICT tools efficiently."

In order to achieve the mastery of competencies, many lecturers have been required to adopt various and diverse applications in their courses to work on those competences. The use of several applications brings new challenges, as the information of the learning processes is distributed among these systems and getting a global picture of the evolution becomes much harder. Therefore, systems that enable gathering and unifying formative assessment information coming from various sources in order to extract significant information about the global learning process are needed. In this paper, we present a system called COBLE (Competence-Based Learning Environment) that supports Competence-based Learning and combines Visual Learning Analytics and recommendation aspects in order to promote the students' and lecturers' self-reflection about the learning and teaching processes. COBLE supports data from different sources to be integrated, providing the users with the complete report of what is going on in their courses."

They provide a digital platform for asynchronous collaboration between students under the monitoring of a supervisor. Additionally, as all the students' interactions are recorded in the wiki database, teachers can retrieve interesting data for skill assessment. On the one hand, there are different approaches for skill assessment based on quantitative data obtained from the wiki. Their main advantage is that they are based on objective data that can be automatically retrieved. Unfortunately, they are rather coarse-grained and different interesting aspects regarding the contributions to the wiki can be dismissed. On the other hand, qualitative approaches offer a more detailed assessment process, but their automation is limited. This can lead to scalability problems in large groups of students. Based on our previous experience using both methods, we propose a mixed approach integrating quantitative and qualitative data for assessment of wiki collaborative assignments. It is supported by the software system Clever Figures 4 MediaWiki, which has been specifically developed for this purpose. Its application shows promising results, generating ranking and charts than combine both sources of information."

The objective was to compare emotional self-reports with automated facial emotion recognition. The latter promises non-intrusive measurements of emotions, which could inform adaptive learning systems. We used an established facial emotion recognition software trained on experts' ratings of facial expressions (FaceReader). For basic emotions, previous studies have reported high agreement of the software with human raters. However, little evidence exists a) on its performance for the epistemic emotions of interest and boredom, b) on its agreement with self-reports, and c) in naturalistic reading situations. We compared the facial expression-based recognition of interest, boredom, and valence of affect to students' self-reports of those emotional states. Analyses of webcam recordings of 103 students revealed no relationship between facial emotion recognition and self-reports. Due to the low agreement of the facial emotion recognition software with self-reports, it remains unclear what the facial expression-based recognition of interest, boredom, and valence actually implies. We advise to wait for more comprehensive evidence a) on the agreement of facial emotion recognition software with self-reports or b) on its predictive validity for learning before applying it in educational practice (e.g., in adaptive learning systems)."

Therefore, this research is part of a project that addresses the creation of a prototype for the analysis of the sentiment of messages on scientific topics on Twitter using supervised machine learning algorithms. These methods require having a large set of data labeled (corpus), to train the model in the best possible way. The detailed process of creating this corpus is the objective of this dissertation. The ultimate goal of the project is to create a function that is able to predict what the value of an input element would be after having been trained with the sentiment classifier. The first results of the classifier show a reliability around 70% in the tested algorithms and from them you can extract adjusted classifications in real time connected to the Twitter Streaming API."

The discussions are based on the idea that there is a scientific consensus that Internet, digital media and social media have changed completely the paradigm in Communication and Education research. But we know the revolution is far from completed. In fact, the scenario keeps changing day by day, what makes new challenges arose constantly. This comes with new risks that have to be, first understood and then faced accordingly, but at the same time it makes this field so rich and interesting.In this context, studies about the use of social media and its effects in education, communication and political or social events become relevant. This fact is evident in those projects trying to understand the way social networks and digital media work. The potential of these new phenomena is still unknown, but the need of education in order to comprehend it, use it properly and exploit all its possibilities is certain. The issues related with education and diffusion present some of the most challenging and urgent aspects in connection with communication and social media. Learning how to take advantage of these new forms of communication as a way to analyse societies or to educate its members (both children and adults) constitutes one of the possibilities with greatest potential in the new media scenario. Using new communication practices, technologies or narratives becomes a very useful tool in order to promote positive values or behaviours in societies."

We examine in this paper the literature that have characterized the types and sources of uncertainty in other fields, with the intent of establishing a foundation upon which build novel computational tools supporting the decision-making under uncertainty processes that DH is currently facing. We propose the use of progressive visual analytics as a feasible means to manage decision-making under uncertainty, which may help tackling some challenges related to the elimination or mitigation of uncertainty in DH, that otherwise would tamper the quality of the yielded results."

Generally, difficulty is estimated by teachers according to their experience and based on students' results. For newly designed activities, this estimation is often inaccurate or complicated to obtain. Moreover, machine learning methods seem impossible to use on absence of data. This work proposes an innovative way to use machine learning in this scenario. We start hypothesizing that the effort a student has to make to perform an activity is correlated with the effort that a machine learning algorithm would require. We define the concept of difficulty in a formal way, implement two Neuroevolution algorithms that solve a specific type of activity, and then calculate and compare efforts for students and implemented algorithms. Results show that the correlation exists for the selected activity. Therefore, the effort of the algorithm can be used to estimate the difficulty of this learning activity."

Nowadays experiments can be performed not only in traditional hands-on labs, but also using online resources, such as simulations and remote labs. This study was carried out, in several Higher Educational Institutions and at a minor extent some Secondary Schools, in Argentina and Brazil, in 25 different courses, where VISIR, a remote lab in the electric and electronics area, was introduced along with other resources. These 39 didactical implementations took place during 2016 and 2017 academic years, yielding 51 teachers and 1563 students. Teachers' perception about student performance in VISIR as well as VISIR usage in course, were cross-analyzed with courses' characteristics. Some important factors arouse teachers should pay extra care designing VISIR tasks accordingly to the learning outcomes/ competences they want their students to develop, taking into consideration if they represent group or individual activities. In fact, students tend to prefer group activities and there seems to be a strong association between this factor and teacher perception about students' satisfaction with the tool. Teacher introduction and support to VISIR along the semester is also an important factor."

A popular toy, the Newton's cradle, can be used to provide a pendular or a collision system, and the movements of the spheres can be tracked by video analysis, using a smartphone. We show that the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy, upon collision of two or more spheres, can be easily confirmed and that the pendular movement can be studied in detail. A more complete analysis, appropriate for undergraduate students in STEM degrees, is also suggested."

The learning process differentiates two qualitative ways of dealing with this process: the deep approach and the superficial approach. The use of each approach depends on the context. However, the adoption of a deep learning approach is positively related to the academic performance. Computational Thinking is defined as a competence of the XXI century, which allows solving problems from a computational point of view, and there is a variety of instruments that allow to measure it, and to know the state in which the evaluated student is. In this paper, we verified the existence of the positive significant relationship between the learning approach and computational thinking in students entering the career of Computer Sciences. By applying Pearson correlation test to verify the relationship between Learning Approaches and Computational Thinking, we found that both variables have homogeneous behaviors and that students show similar conditions. Men are in better conditions than women on the evaluated aspects of the Computational Thinking, Also, we found a significantly positive relationship between Computational Thinking and the Learning Approach (r = 0,882). This result shows that the learning approaches that students' practice are linked to the computational thinking they demonstrate. According to the results, the teachers of this career must develop active and deep methodological strategies due to the predisposition in these students."

This definition encourages us to reconcile the main objectives of both areas by integrating a user-centred, human-computer interaction approach, where verbal and non-verbal communication of meaning and affordances is central. Disciplinary and technological challenges are reviewed and confronted with some of our strategies to cope with them. By embracing the above holistic definition, and incorporating accessibility as a key factor both for the practice and the teaching of localisation, we try to make the most of the linkages between technology, communication, social and user needs, as well as professional and research-driven translatorial action."

Investigating the challenges of cross-cultural parenting can help us support this growing demographic, as well as better understand how families integrate and negotiate advice from diverse online and offline sources in making parenting decisions. We interviewed parents from 18 families to understand the practices they adopt to meet the challenges of cross-cultural parenting. We investigated how these families respond to conflicts while integrating diverse cultural views, as well as how they utilize the wealth of parenting resources available online in navigating these tasks. We identify five themes focused on how these families find and evaluate advice, connect with social support, resolve intra-family tensions, incorporate multicultural practices, and seek out diverse views. Based on our findings, we contribute three implications for design and translations of these implications to concrete technology ideas that aim to help families better integrate multiple cultures into everyday life."

These processes are time and resource intensive and require skill in written communication, placing a significant administrative burden on the small, already under-resourced organisations who interact with programs. NFP’s now have the technical literacy to create rich video content, but little is understood about how video could be used instead of, or alongside traditional written reports. We present findings from a novel funding acquittal (final report) process that we designed for a government grant programme to explore the affordances of video from the perspective of the grantee. We discuss the affordances of structured short-form video to overcome the barriers faced by organisations during these reporting processes. We present design considerations for digitally mediated processes that could support the media augmentation of these established workflows."

Using a quantitative methodology, pre and post measurement instruments will be applied, and statistical analysis will be carried out. Through the qualitative methodology, the development process of the aforementioned skills will be analysed from each student's individual self-records and the argumentative discussions of the student teams. The population includes all new students who study the subject, The Social and Political History of Chile from the Social Work degree program, in a public University located in Chile. The Halpern Critical Thinking Assessment using Everyday Situations (HCTAES) was used to measure the students' argumentative skills. The metacognitive skills were measured by the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Both instruments are translated and validated for the Latin-American population. The main result is contribution to the development of a systemic educational Innovaci\'{o} model that integrates two great higher order thinking skills such as Metacognition and Argumentation through the use of ICT and collaborative work."

Higher Educational Institutions (HEI) are not different from other organizations in which concerns these problems. Determining the organizational positioning of an organization current strategy will allow to combine monitoring and benchmarking methods to foster the identification of opportunities and threats, which can serve as inputs for the internal evaluation of social media strategies', for the necessary strategic readjustments and a subsequent efficiency measurement. In order to address these challenges, we propose a three-step automatic data-mining procedure to assess the posting behavior and strategy of HEI, understand the editorial policy behind it, and predict the future HEI engagement. We used a sample of the 5-top ranked educational institutions in 2017. We collected the posts from each HEI official Facebook page during an entire school year. Our method showed high degree of accuracy and is also capable of describing which topics are most common in each university's social media content strategy and relate them to the corresponding response from their publics."

We focused on analyzing social media users' attitudes toward civil participation in national politics in Spain. It is contemplated that participative attitudes toward electoral events might emerge as effects from political communications through social media networking in the era of continuous advance of information communication technologies. With the purpose of testing this hypothesis, a two by two factor experimental study was designed. Thus, four experiments in laboratory were developed to test the likelihood of significant influences of political communications in social media network over the users' readiness for civil participation. By doing so, we intended to contextualize citizens' mobilization in political participation in the time when the electoral process in Spain was full of complications during 2015-2016."

With a strong informative foundation derived from the analysis of collected data, decision-makers can make strategic choices with the aim of obtaining valuable benefits in their specific areas of action. However, given the steady growth of data volumes, data analysis needs to rely on powerful tools to enable knowledge extraction. Dashboards offer a software solution for visually analyzing large volumes of data in order to identify patterns and relations and make decisions according to the presented information. But decision-makers may have different goals and, consequently, different necessities regarding their dashboards. Having a methodology to efficiently generate dashboards taking into account differing needs would add a customization layer to allow particular users to reach their own goals. This approach can be achieved through domain engineering and automatic code generation processes. This paper presents the application of domain engineering within the dashboards' domain through a case study in the context of the Spanish Observatory for University Employment and Employability, in which a set of dashboards can be generated to exploit different perspectives of employment and employability data in the academic context."

This material gives the pieces' characteristics such as: lightness and resistance. In addition, with the use of this material the geometry of the pieces to be built is not limited as in the systems of traditional manufacture of composite material. For this reason, we will work with thermoplastic materials and epoxy adhesives on an additive manufacturing machine based on the FFF technique. The composite material has been obtained by a new manufacturing system. An adhesive extruder head has been designed which has been manufactured using the FFF technique. This new extruder is implemented in an AM RepRap machine next to the thermoplastic filament extruder. The joint printing of both materials, in alternating layers, generates a composite material that allows to increase the structural properties of the piece in the XY plane. The new additive manufacturing system allows to obtain mechanical improvements both in the modulus of elasticity and in the tensile strength. Increase the modulus of elasticity of a value between 50-80% depending on the thermoplastic filament used. In the same way the tensile strength has increased between 50-60%. The improvement in the strength / weight ratio makes this new additive manufacturing system allows to create medical pieces in which the lightness and resistance are its main characteristic such as orthopedic prostheses. The study shows that the use of FFF together with Robocasting, as a manufacturing process for end-use parts, generates an additional advantage that had not been considered until now. The combination of a thermoplastic and an epoxy resin opens a new path in the additive manufacturing since it allows creating pieces with new qualities without being conditioned by the design."

To apply the process, a log with requests and responses of remote experiments from the VISIR project were analyzed. A request is the setup of the experiment including the assembled circuits and the configurations of the measuring equipment. In turn, a response is a message provided by the measurement server indicating measures or an error when it is not possible to execute the experiment. Along the two phases of analysis, the log was analyzed and summarized in order to provide insights about students' experiments. In addition, there is a recommendation service responsible for analyzing the requests thus returning, in case of error, precise information about the assembly of circuits or configurations. The evaluation of the process is consistent in what regards its ability to afford recommendations to the students as they carry out the experiments. Moreover, the summarized information intends to offer teachers means to better understand and develop strategies to scaffold students' learning."

In some cases, the ethics behind the use or access by third parties are not clear. This situation raises adverse reactions and feelings of fear that generates a negative perception towards the use of Learning Analytics. In consequence, it is questioned whether privacy and security can be preserved when collecting educational data. As a result, some policies and good practices are set to frame how student data should be used in the application of this analytical approach. Its objective is to increase confidence in the application of Learning Analytics. However, some of these legal actions, which are limited to the areas in which they are originated, are the result of allegations of data leakage. Hence, these initiatives can do little to insure the use of sensitive data of students in unknown situations. To ensure continuity and an increase of confidence in the application of Learning Analytics is necessary to bind to legality a new approach to safeguard privacy of students' data in its current and future uses. Considering the above, it is possible to add a technological layer above these policies that ensures its viability. Some emerging technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts are strong candidates to ensure privacy and secure sensible data of students. The use of smart contracts allows the automation of legal actions so that they are executed as soon as irregularities in the use or data collection are detected. In this work, we propose a series of actions to preserve the identity of students and secure their data with emerging technologies such as blockchain."

The research question to be answered is: how does the user experience influence the success or failure of the acceptance of an Institutional Repository? The survey consists of four points in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM): perceived utility (PU), perceived ease of use (EU), attitudes towards use (ATU) and intention to use (BIU). The pilot survey was applied to 47 students enrolled in the virtual course ""Visibility of open knowledge through the RITEC"". The results obtained from the reliability analysis, using Cronbach's alpha index, indicate the high internal consistency of the survey. The validity of the survey focuses on the content validity, valued by a group of experts."

The method implies two phases, both related to peer and self-evaluation. Peer and self-evaluation are performed both externally and internally in work groups. We demonstrate that it is easy for the students to have a strong agreement when evaluating a good performance of a group. Results from the internal evaluation of the members of the groups reveal that students can detect bad behaviors that highly correlate with bad results in the final exam. This system could be used as a good predictor of bad attitudes or strategies throughout the learning process."

This project arises from this need, and seeks the development of information literacy in primary and secondary school pupils through the implementation of a special teacher training programme. We worked with a final sample of 37 teachers and 318 pupils from 7 schools in Castile and Le\'{o}n. A training course was initially developed for the teachers, who subsequently carried out an innovation project in their schools with their pupils to develop information literacy. Afterwards, the pupils' information literacy proficiency level was assessed and compared with the results of a previous diagnostic assessment. The results showed that, while primary school pupils experienced a highly significant increase in their proficiency levels for the assessed competency, secondary school pupils remained at similar levels. Our conclusion emphasises the importance of this kind of intervention to promote the development and assessment of key competencies throughout the period of compulsory education."

However, currently the level of academic performance and motivation of students to learn this science is not the desired one. The students can use different learning tools inside and outside the math classroom, enhancing the quality of the learning materials that are designed essentially to facilitate the learning of mathematics. The present research project aims to determine the validity and reliability of a measurement instrument that allows the assessment of the satisfaction of the students with the available learning materials. To fulfill the objectives of this research, the method of survey was used. A study with a quantitative approach was developed, which led to the design and validation of a questionnaire by a group of 7 experts. The validation closed after applying a pilot study with 728 students. It concluded positively, obtaining nine factors that coincide with the revision of the literature: technological quality, quality of content, visual quality, didactic significance, adequacy of content, relationship between theory and practice, involvement, contribution to learning, relevance and interaction between educational actors. The results of this questionnaire provide to the international scientific community with relevant information for the design, selection, and use of study materials in the classrooms, which will contribute to raising the levels of student engagement, and their academic performance in mathematics, secondarily."

This methodology will be based on three pillars. The first one is, the Organizational/Human Centred Design that link knowledge transfer on energy efficiency with behavioural and organizational change models, second, the Active Peer-Based Flip Teaching to convert individual to organisational knowledge trying to improve results and promote new knowledge and resources generation. Last pillar is a personal learning environment applied on an online open access platform to support and host this knowledge and community. Two approaches are proposed for testing the methodology. General test, based on surveys and focus groups with key actors on the one hand; and sector test, based on real implementation in the agrofood sector employing the INDUCE European project which will create an open access platform and will test the methodology in 15 pilot companies from the food and beverage sector from Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and France."

A survey was developed with 207 university students from 42 universities (Chinese and Spanish) who voluntary responds to a questionnaire. A pilot study was performed in order to test the correspondence validity of the two versions (Chinese and Spanish) of the same questionnaire. The results show that watching subtitled Spanish films and series has been preferred by the respondents and they do it frequently. In addition, they take it as an effective way to learn Spanish. Likewise, the results indicate that the respondents are not satisfied with the current situation of the film and television market with subtitling neither in China nor Spain. Therefore, they wish to have more access to Spanish films and series resources in China and more subtitled version in Spain."

Since Clavy makes it possible to dynamically modify the structure of the repositories, it must support a navigation model independent of that structure. For this purpose, the platform adopts a tag-based browsing model, according to which users select descriptive tags to filter learning objects (in Clavy, these descriptive tags correspond to element-value pairs). In our experience using Clavy, we have realized that updating the browsing state when the user changes the set of selected tags can be a costly process. The proposed strategy alleviates this cost by combining inverted indexes with a multilevel cache model that enables the system, on the one hand, to cache filtered objects (i.e., set of objects filtered by sets of selected tags), and, on the other hand, selectable tags (i.e., set of tags able to shrink sets of objects)."
2018,Document Annotation Tools: Annotation Classification Mechanisms,"Gayoso-Cabada, Joaqu\'{\i}n and Sarasa-Cabezuelo, Antonio and Sierra, Jos\'{e}-Luis",10.1145/3284179.3284331,https://doi.org/10.1145/3284179.3284331,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"Document annotation tools have been widely used in technology-enhanced learning. Through these tools, students can associate annotations with fragments of documents, which enhances the thorough analysis of content and develops meta-reflective thinking. Likewise, annotation tools can facilitate collaborative annotation among students, as well as implement innovative interaction mechanisms. In addition, most tools provide mechanisms for classifying annotations. These mechanisms facilitate the subsequent retrieval of relevant annotations. Therefore, classification mechanisms are essential to facilitating the evaluation of work done by students, promoting collaborative work in annotation communities, etc. In addition, classification mechanisms help students better understand what they should annotate, implicitly guiding them during annotation activities. However, while there are multiple studies focusing on other aspects of annotation tools, the classification aspect has deserved only marginal attention in the literature. This work makes an exploratory study focused on this essential, although somewhat ignored, requirement. As a result, five main approaches to annotation classification are identified: absence of classification mechanisms, classification based on annotation modes, classification by predefined semantic categories, classification based on folksonomies, and classification based on ontologies."

Our research focus lies on the investigation of language elaboration processes in Middle Low German. We are particularly interested in diachronic constructional changes and constructionalizations involving and affecting all linguistic dimensions. For this, it is necessary to annotate our corpus with Part-of-Speech and constructional tags. Here, we are confronted with gradualness, gradience, and ambiguity as potential sources of uncertainty that complicate the annotation process. Furthermore, due to the historicity of the investigated language, we expect cases of incomplete knowledge and comparative fallacy from the annotators. For this reason, we develop an interface that captures all annotators' doubts."

With the emergence and penetration of mobile devices in all aspects of everyday life, the teaching-learning process must be changed to encourage participation and to achieve effective results. Thus, the use of gamification tools such as Kahoot can help in this challenge, as they encourage the effective acquisition of competences through play and competition. This study demonstrates the positive results of including gamification processes in the Spanish public and private university classroom, contrasting their effectiveness in different degrees and subjects."

However, there is a lack of quantitative data on students' performance, especially in engineering courses. A flipped-classroom methodology has been developed in two different engineering degrees with 167 students. In both degrees also a control group with 156 students has been taught using the classical methodology. Through the data collected it is possible to measure the impact of learning (through the usual exams), to reduce the class absenteeism and to increase the exams attendance. Also, the students' implication with the new methodology can be checked by the use of YouTube analytics. The results show that the flipped-classroom model improves the results, at least in partial examinations. Furthermore, as the marks dispersion are lower, can be state that diversity has been treated in a better way."

On the other hand, embedding difficult mechanics through software tools or sophisticated systems which require programming knowledge to be implemented. This is what we denominate Complex Gamification. In this paper, we propose a novel and intermediate alternative to design even a whole gamified course aimed to intrinsic motivation and without requirements of computer programming skills, using simple and existing software tools. We present Enchanted Talk, an experience of multiplayer Gamification using Google Spreadsheets, focused on the importance of creating an attractive and fun environment to really motivate students."

The purpose of this research is to understand the impact on student learning and performance that including technology such as virtual reality in the classroom may have. To this end we have opted for the use of a quasi-experimental design by means of two groups: a first experimental group, that uses a virtual reality application, and a control group that receives a traditionally cut master class. After the quantitative and qualitative analysis carried out, the results show that there are statistically significant differences in the scores of the pretest and posttest tests in favor of the experimental group, that is, of the students who performed the activity with virtual reality. They improved their performance against the students that used the traditional master class methodology. In addition, the results of the user experience survey, passed after using the app, were positive. In most of the cases, the average is above 4 over 5 for the degree of overall satisfaction shown by the students. Being very high/excellent for 60% of students and high for 40%. Due to these factors, we can conclude that the impact of virtual reality activities in the classroom is beneficial for the learning and the academic results of the students, in addition to their motivation."

This study aimed to analyze changes in CFFT before and after the incremental cycle ergometer test as a means to assess the fatigue of the CNS. CFFT ascending and descending, the subjective criterion and sensory sensitivity were analyzed in 8 professional male cyclists (72.1±5.59 kg, 180.3±6.43 cm, 17.4±0.7 years) before and after a maximum incremental cycle ergometer test (start 50w increases 50w each 5 minutes). In this incremental test, the induced fatigue was probably more a peripheral phenomenon than one due to central nervous system fatigue, because sensory sensitivity did not significantly decrease. In conclusion, an incremental cycle ergometer test increased the cortical arousal and does not affect negatively the CNS of professional cyclists."

In this study, regulations on educational guidance (n = 51 documents) at Primary Education of the seventeen Autonomous Communities and the Autonomous Cities (Ceuta and Melilla) are analyzed and compared by means of content analyses. Results of this research indicate that the most frequent educational guidance services are, on the one hand, general services known as Educational and Psychopedagogical Guidance Services comprised of counsellors that visit schools on part-time basis and offer their services to the general population of students and, on the other hand, specialized services for students with special educational needs due to specific disabilities or disorders. As a new tendency, full-time internal educational guidance units have emerged at schools in 6 Autonomous Communities that substitute or coexist with Educational and Psychopedagogical Guidance Services. The main conclusion of this study is that, although there is a fairly common structure at national level regarding educational guidance services for mainstream students, there is certain heterogeneity of services for students with special educational needs in terms of types of disabilities, organization, functions and characteristics."

Frequently the planning of these is top-bottom, designing services, rules, financial aid announcements, conferences and repositories. However, the most important fact of the educational innovation is the property of making dynamic, apply and exchange experience between teachers. For this objective it is required a bottom-up perspective coming from the faculty and alumni. This work uses a survey, already validated, to fix indicators associated to the development of each educational innovation project. This survey was carried out with the participants of the MOOC Applied Educational Innovation, 2nd edition, in which participants are grouped by educational sectors (university and non-university) and role (teachers and alumni). The survey had over a thousand participants and a set of variables have been rated. These variables are useful to streamline, organize and improve the policies in educational innovation."

The objective of the paper is to present the thesis Project, which addresses the study of the causality of this gap, associating the possible relationship with gender roles and stereotypes assumed, together with cultural factors, such as the origin of the person. This paper describes the research project to study this situation and establish new fieldwork, using a mixed methodology, taking into account the specific variables and dimensions. In this fieldwork, we want young people between the ages of 16 and 30 to tell their story. From the evaluation of the current situation through the sequential mixed exploratory research method and from the longitudinal cohort to be carried out with the target population, palliative measures can be derived to reduce the gender gap. The project will be carried out in three phases: preparation, research, and evaluation, each of which will be carried out using different techniques and instruments. The data collected will help to identify the relationship between the gender gap and ethnic and racial factors. Finally, it can be concluded that in order to generate and achieve equal representation, one must first know the motivation and interests of people, which lead to different decisions being made and being able to work on them."

This situation generates a series of peculiarities that differentiate them from their commercial counterparts. The present article proposes to define the types, functions and self-determination of the Ecuadorian university media, through a documentary review of the researches developed in this field, and the application of structured interviews to its directors. The results allow identifying the characteristics of the Ecuadorian university media, marked by the institutional model that is ascribed to the academic units, a range of functions that respond to institutional needs, and a self-determination that, at times, differs from the HEI type. which is ascribed to align with the community or generate a mixture beyond what is determined in current Ecuadorian regulations, ratifying their status as differentiated actors in the national media scenario."

They are also the two stations that have bet the most on the production of podcasts, whose consumption is meant for the Internet, not traditional radio. This article discusses the activity generated around these types of programmes in the two social networks in which the aforementioned radio stations have more global presence: Facebook and Twitter. A purely quantitative method is used to analyze the presence of these programmes on the aforementioned social networks and, particularly, number of posts, formats and forms of interaction. The paper concludes that the use of social networks by the radio networks is very heterogeneous and does not reflect patterns of use: while some programmes have many followers, others have very few. In addition, the number of posts they make is also very diverse, and so it is their forms of interaction. As a reflection, it is important to emphasize that not all radio stations take advantage of social networks in the same way and to the same extent."

How to address these issues is context dependent. In this paper, we address uncertainties in the citizen-driven archive Topotheque as a concrete use-case in the Digital Humanities project exploreAT!, and demonstrate, how to deal with uncertainties by benchmarking a set of selected commercial computer vision (CV) tools. The approach aims to enrich Topotheque's data to enable better access, connectivity and analysis for both researchers and citizens. Results show that by applying CV, existing uncertainties are noticeably reduced, but new ones also introduced. Better grounds for semantic structuring are provided, enabling higher connectivity and linking within Topotheque, but also across other data sets. Ultimately, the enrichment of the archive is for the benefit of both researchers and citizens enabled by addressing and tackling apparent uncertainties."

The usual approaches to knowledge representation and information modelling, often taken from engineering or natural science disciplines, lack the ability to express these concerns. Also, software systems for digital humanities should acknowledge that imprecise and uncertain information exists, but current software development technologies fall short of providing satisfactory approaches to implementing such ""soft"" issues.In this paper we propose a theoretical framework to define, characterise and express information imprecision and uncertainty in digital humanities, and describe a semi-formal implementation on top of the ConML conceptual modelling language. The proposal has been applied to a real project in digital humanities.Using this approach, imprecise and uncertain knowledge can be represented, so that models and simulations in digital humanities provide a better account of the reality being modelled. Also, software systems (including databases, search engines or analytical algorithms) can exploit these aspects to yield more faithful results."

However, due to their quantity, variety and the technology used, it is difficult to manage them, mainly as regards the consultation and identification of the most appropriate resources to carry out a specific training action. A possible solution would be to develop (1) a repository that offers an overview of all resources generated, regardless of the technology, variety and types; (2) an ontology, which permits their classification; and (3) a semantic search system that allows a user to make a quick and effective retrieval. This research-based paper shows the results obtained using a content manager, which centralizes the resources created by the students in some technologies. Also, two tools have been developed: an ontology, which permits resources of a subject to be classified, and a plugin for WordPress, which allows the ontologies are building through the use of tags and categories, as well as to provide them with a semantic search engine through inferences between ontology-related elements---. Through a result cross-check, students' perception of the repository use has been measured. It has been found that, on the one hand, the system proposed is adequate to manage the resources generated by the students; and, on the other, their availability has been useful for them."

The methodology was applied as an attempt to optimize the teacher's ability to respond to the great amount of student queries and to ensure positive outcomes in terms of students' mid-term assessment. Results reveal that flipping learning per se did not produce a high impact on the achievement of the intended teaching goals nor students' grades. The set of conducted analyses demonstrate, however, relevant patterns on students' behavior, namely: which were the adopted learning strategies and how did they handle multimedia learning resources."

Gamification provides an opportunity to extend regular learning management systems and virtual learning environments with game-like elements, such as points, levels, and meaningful narrative. This paper describes the implementation and usage of gamified assignments in Web Development. Firstly, we analyzed gamification possibilities in higher educational institutions. After each assignment, we gathered feedback from students to study their involvement, motivation, and influence of gamification on how the information was perceived. Based on the results, several suggestions for the improvement are discussed, such as adaptive variable difficulty or making the achievements public in order to increase social motivational drive influence."

Using of online learning allowed avoiding level conditional limitation of education and providing learning opportunities for students, regardless of their location, age, social affiliation. The methodological basis of the research is the subject-oriented approach making practice-oriented research tactics. The basic principles of the subject-oriented approach are the focus on self-education, self-actualization and creative self-realization of the individual. All learners studied with distance format which provided them a wide range of educational opportunities such as the variability of the course content, the free choice of the forms of individual and group training. In the process of conducting the study addressed the task activation of the subject in the process of individualization of learning content. A wide range of educational resources allows taking into account all the educational needs and creating individual development path. The introduction of distance learning format in the process of aesthetic education in the system of continuous education of the Kazan University has allowed to implement the basic principles of the subject-oriented approach, and on this basis may be considered a promising direction for further research in this area."

Such growth is particularly significant in the area of radiology as the number of publications and related bibliographical sources clearly show. There are multiple digital collections that contribute to organizing knowledge regarding this area, either for clinical research or education purposes. The current work is focused on using the huge amount of medical cases available in these collections to support specific training courses, particularly addressed to medical residents who combine the practice of medicine and instruction. Such support is based on retrieving information items from these extant digital collections and generating instructional resources that can be deployed in the resident training context. The key element for this information management is a tool called Clavy, which retrieves pieces of content in medical collections that are usually poorly structured and arrange them in a versatile and powerful organization. The resultant knowledge structure produced in Clavy allows hospital tutors to generate educational resources easily under standard specifications and work with them in the most popular e-learning platforms. An example of a radiology course was implemented to demonstrate how the application of Clavy can deal with the generation and use of training resources in a Moodle platform. The assessment of this course reveals the participants' engagement in this modality of e-learning instruction and shows its potential."

It is modified throughout life and it is determined by the particular anatomical characteristics that directly affect the biomechanics of the spine. The possibility to have a method for the systematic postural characterization of the lumbar spine is essential to be able to have an objective resource for the knowledge of body posture. The present study proposes the development of a morphological postural model of the spine in the lumbar region. The model is based on a system of measurement of objective and comparable parameters by means of X-ray analysis, in order to characterize its morphology in the sagittal plane. The systematization through geometric and mathematical models is very useful in the measurement and study of the lumbar spine in disciplines such as biomechanics, orthopedics, physiotherapy, sports, simulation or ergonomics and industrial design."

Disadvantaged and developing countries are the most committed in this area as they are very aware of the benefits education can bring. Latin America has made progress in this field and to pave the way for a prosperous future it is necessary to document what has been done, what is being done and what is being approached from a scientific point of view. Ultimately, the educational advancement of a country, to a large extent, also depends on the advancement of education as a science. Therefore, this work offers a literature review that aims to identify the aspects that are being addressed in this field, taking education as an object of scientific study within the Latin American community. Based on the analysis of the most-cited research articles, we aim to identify the predominant subjects and geographical locations in research on education in Latin America. The application of a method based on systematic literature review indicates that there is still a low incidence of scientific documents that relate the variables ""Education"" and ""Latin America"". Other results speak of an object of study based on geographical totality, not specific countries, and references to generic educational levels. Finally, ""social policy"" stands as the main sub-theme of study related to education."

That is, any of the services offered by the universities (hereafter university will be considered as a synonym of a higher education institution - HEI). The work addresses the question, of how can we measure the quality of education offered by HEIs. And in particular, how to do it counting with the opinion of their main user: the student. Education is a type of service, and as such, educational institutions that offer it must try to satisfy the wishes and needs of users to whom it is addressed. Getting feedback from students about the origins of the quality of the higher education they receive should help towards reaching this goal. Therefore, it will be appropriate to define the quality of higher education from the perspective of the student. For this purpose, a multidisciplinary theoretical framework will be established, based on an approach, that conceives quality as meeting the needs and expectations of customers. Seeking to achieve the defined objective, we developed a solid theoretical framework, following the next stages of analysis. First, higher education was defined as a service. Second, the possible roles of the student of higher education were analyzed, particularly within the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). In this context, a new ""continuum of student orientation"" theoretical model of relations between the university and their students is proposed. Third, the concept of quality in higher education was defined, approaching it from the perspective of the student who perceives his/her service. Fourth, the ""Gaps Model of Service Quality applied to higher education"" framework was established. And fifth, the relationship between service quality and satisfaction in the field of higher education was addressed. This framework would serve later as foundation for the development of a measurement scale of the quality of service perceived by the student of higher education for both 'online' and 'offline' services. Finally, including the above theoretical model in the mentioned framework, and considering the application of structural equation modelling for statistical methodology, causal relationships between latent variables and the existence of a moderating effect of the variable ""student orientation to learning"" is proposed."

In the present dual study, potential explanations for this perceptively high percentage of error incidence is explored by means of a survey of the central figures in the writing and editing process: the authors and journal editors. In Study 1, the authors (n=16) of abstracts with three or more errors were sent a questionnaire about how the abstract was prepared for publication and who was involved in this process. The questionnaire also asked authors to reflect on their experience and provide relevant insights. In Study 2, the journal editors (n=10) were asked to complete an on-line survey about the journal's procedures vis \`{a} vis abstracts and their own attitudes to a number of issues regarding English abstracts. Six (37.5%) authors and six (60%) editors responded. A gap in quality was detected in which English abstracts containing errors could be published and widely disseminated on-line: non-native English speaking authors who wrote or translated their own abstracts in(to) English and submitted unrevised or inadequately revised versions could have their abstracts published in journals that lacked the internal or external native English-speaking personnel and other resources to determine the quality of the English abstract and simply accepted the author's version as correct and natural."

To identify design opportunities for promoting meaningful engagement, we conducted an ethnographic study on organised activities in an Australian aged care home. We observed staff fostered engagement by initiating conversations, weaving residents’ backgrounds into interactions, and adapting activities to residents’ varying abilities. However, challenges included new staff members’ unfamiliarity with residents, multi-tasking, and insufficient support to engage excluded residents. Using a care ethics lens that includes relational, situated and empathetic features of care, we show that meaningful engagement is shaped by the ethical care practices embedded in staff-resident interactions and highlight opportunities for technologies to mitigate barriers hindering staff from providing ethical care in existing activities. These opportunities include: collecting and recording residents’ interests, providing conversation prompts, enhancing activity inclusiveness, and reducing language and cultural barriers."

This is mainly connected to the strong implication of professors' competences and to the quality of the higher education which, in turn, have a direct relationship with the changes that the universities have experienced since the Bologna Plan. This Plan has impacted the history of each institution of higher education. Indeed, in the current period, the worldwide educational systems are making efforts to change their structures and modifying didactic and pedagogical approaches. It is therefore essential to consider the changes and the challenges of the teaching staff. The aim of this research is to compare and evaluate the pedagogical training of university professors as well as to investigate the different models that each university developed to implement its version of pedagogical training."

Information overload and easy access to information make it more likely to steal intellectual property and increases the unethical use of information. Problems related to the effective use and management of information persist and lead students to academic plagiarism. The intention therefore, through this research, is to discover whether improvements in the development of information competencies help tackle this problem. A mixed research methodology is proposed, to better understand the extent of the problem based on a quantitative analysis; a qualitative assessment will also be used to understand its causes. Data collection instruments, i.e. university student questionnaires and interviews will be designed to fulfil the objectives set out in this research: to analyse whether university students have developed information competencies or not, and whether these competencies lead to academic plagiarism. The data obtained will be used to create a training program aimed at tackling the problem. The program will be based on resources used from students' very first year at university, thus achieving significant changes in the learning process."

The authors think that these units are the realization of Media Aesthetics principles which generally was formed in the epoch of social networks. It is characterized with such principles as performance, combination of verbal and nonverbal types of sign, reign of image over words, democracy of communication, priority of self-presentation, interaction and materialization of sense perception. Also the article provides with the analyses of the term ""multimedia text"" analogous to multimedia text, defines esthetic foundation and stylistic characteristics of multimedia texts. It is determined that creativity in creation and publishing of multimedia texts becomes a form of social activity presence of social network users. The category of creativity is realized through the deconstruction of official culture, through irony and humour on everything which refers to a norm. This helped defining the means of multimedia creativity: precedence, language play, irony, collage. The method of case study helped revealing the fact that a multimedia message makes a greater impact on the communicative behaviour of social networks users than a common verbal message, it becomes a repost more frequently."

It is based on a literature review based on a protocol developed in order to capture each of the investigations that interest this study through three databases or reference searchers (Dialnet, WoS and Scopus). The concepts that this work contemplates are the key to the Framing Theory used in the recovered literature. Emphasis is also placed on historical discrepancies of this theoretical basis, such as the case of authors who prefer to opt for the second phase Agenda Setting, instead of referring to the Framing Theory.With this work we also want to see which authors are referenced when dealing with the Framing Theory and the definitions that are provided, as well as other issues that help researchers focus their response searches, as is the case of the sources and the actors, resources used to find out the construction of frames by the media, because, ""the selection of sources is the most natural way in which the media build frames"" [1].This study aims to offer a clear and systemic vision of the approach of the Framing Theory in combination or not with the Agenda Setting Theory."

The research in software ecosystems is a relatively young research area, but there are already several works that analyse the literature associated. To conduct a new systematic literature review is necessary to ensure that there are no studies that do the same, namely, that do not answer the same research questions. The identification of the need for a review was done through a study focused on systematic literature reviews and mapping studies about software ecosystems. This work aims to describe the mapping conducted as part of that study. It provides a global state of the art of this kind of studies in the area of software ecosystems."

Established human centric concepts will not be able to handle the instream of un- or semi-structured material or handle analogue documentation. We suggest the use of artificial intelligence to pre-classify and organize historic photographs in collections and archives. With regard to uncertainty the concept of artificial intelligence based classification is discussed based on two questions: (1) What is the uncertainty in current archival documentation, assuming that the quality and completeness of a current classification depends on the partial and restricted knowledge of a person? (2) Can algorithmic concepts help to quantify the level of uncertainty? The aspect of documentation is discussed based on a comparison of algorithms and classical processes. The contribution of artificial intelligence to quantify the uncertainty is tested in a case study. For this an artificial neural network / convolutional neural network was trained and tested on a collection of historical photographs."

Here we report the results of a trans-national study on the perceptions of different stakeholder groups (namely students, employers, instructors and civic institutions) about the relative importance of digital competences, the effectiveness of current offerings and the best approaches for their acquisition. The European DigComp 2.1 framework for digital skills was used as a way of structuring the inquiry process based on surveys and focus groups. Results showed some differences in perception across groups and a clear focus on information search and communication abilities as priorities, but also to a perceived gap between the needs and the actual abilities of students. Results also point out to situated and problem-based learning approaches as adequate instructional methods."

This paper presents a revision of the literature about the potential of using video annotation in the education context, specifically in the domain of Physics, using an open source annotation tool. The creation of audiovisual references, either for quick access to parts of organized video annotated content by the teacher, knowledge building or revision by and for other students is analyzed. This study is complemented with a testbed, showing the potential of using audiovisual annotated content, within a k-12 context. Students were invited to select video content, annotate, organize and publish the annotations, which could support the learning process in the domain of Physics. Results show that most of the aspects under analysis received a positive evaluation. The only exception relates to the capacity of the approach to motivated students to the study of Physics, as most of the students did not see this methodology as a motivating means."

Therefore, it is very useful and is widely used for the communication of information through the Internet and for the electronic academic publication. The PDF allows embedding 3D objects in the latest versions, and although this technology has great potential for the communication of these data, today is not a tool widely used by the scientific community or biomedical research. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the tools offered by the PDF software regarding the visualization of three-dimensional models, especially for biomedical images of three-dimensional models generated from radiological images."
2018,Agile methods as problem-based learning designs: setting and assessment,"Barriocanal, Elena Garc\'{\i}a and Sicilia, Miguel-Angel and S\'{a}nchez-Alonso, Salvador and Cuadrado, Juan-Jos\'{e}",10.1145/3284179.3284237,https://doi.org/10.1145/3284179.3284237,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"Problem-based learning has been proved as a good method to teach Software Engineering, concretely when project development skills are involved. In those cases, project work departs from some stakeholder requirements that are often ill-defined, and the team progresses by analysis and design identifying the parts that the team can develop and which of them requires further investigation. From a teaching perspective, agile methods like Scrum perfectly fit the problem-based learning model, since sprint results can provide a good indicator of group and individual student progress. In this paper, a case study aimed at introducing learning analytics in an instructional design for Advanced Software Engineering courses using problem-based learning approach is reported. Learning analytics were carried out both from the project work process, adopting some tools of the platform used to manage task and activities (Jira Software), and from the obtained final grade, using Jupyter notebooks."
2018,A Preliminary Study of Proof of Concept Practices and their Connection with Information Systems and Information Science,"Neto, Antonio Jose Rodrigues and Borges, Maria Manuel and Roque, Licinio",10.1145/3284179.3284226,https://doi.org/10.1145/3284179.3284226,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"In this study, we have identified that a Proof of Concept can be characterized as a research practice and instrument of knowledge creation, based on a set of activities that are applied to the study and understanding of certain objects by the actors involved. In Information Systems Development, we have characterized a Proof of Concept as a system that creates socio-technical phenomena and, with the aim of understanding these phenomena, we use the Context Engineering approach. Context Engineering represents the relationship between a set of essential movements in a new framework of activities of Information Systems Development. Furthermore, we highlight Information Science, which allows us to study in formal and rigorous ways the processes, techniques, conditions, and effects that are entailed in improving the efficacy of information, which is used for a range of purposes related to individual, social and organizational needs, as well as new methods of scientific communication. To our knowledge, and following a review of the literature, there is a lack of studies combined with gaps in the knowledge of Proof of Concept practices. The misunderstanding of these practices may strengthen the probability of compromising the reliability, reproducibility, and reusability of the knowledge consumed or constructed in a Proof of Concept, which may affect its appropriate utilization by the organizations, their actors, or communities of practice. In this context, this paper aims to promote a preliminary study of the state-of-the-art scientific knowledge and to contribute to the body of published literature on Proof of Concept practices."

Since local universities lack the tools to gather and systematize information related to their research activities, the development of specific indicators is crucial. This research focused on what factors should be measured and how they should be measured to assess scientific and technological capacity at local universities. The objective was to design a system of indicators. To achieve this aim, the authors reviewed 42 background studies and established a theoretical model based on the Theories of Change and an adapted version of the Baseline Measurement Methodology. The research found that Scientific Production, Research Procedures, and Scientific and Technological Infrastructure are the influencing factors on scientific and technological capacity at universities. The results also showed that measuring these factors requires a comprehensive system of indicators."

This paper investigates the visualization of ethics through a subset of GenAI models. We expand on the emerging field of Visual Ethics, using art as a form of critical inquiry and the metaphor of a kaleidoscope to invoke moral imagination. Through formative interviews with 10 ethics experts, we first establish a foundation of ethical theories. Our analysis reveals five families of ethical theories, which we then transform into images using the text-to-image (T2I) GenAI model. The resulting imagery, curated as Kaleidoscope Gallery and evaluated by the same experts, revealed eight themes that highlight how morality, society, and learned associations are central to ethical theories. We discuss implications for critically examining T2I models and present cautions and considerations. This work contributes to examining ethical theories as foundational knowledge that interrogates GenAI models as socio-technical systems."

Over recent years Aquaponics systems have received increased attention due to its possibilities in helping reduce strain on resources within 1st and 3rd world countries. Aquaponics is the combination of Hydroponics and Aquaculture and mimics a natural environment in order to successfully apply and enhance the understanding of natural cycles within an indoor process. By using this knowledge of natural cycles it was possible to create a system with the capabilities similar to that of a natural environment with the benefits of electronic adaptions to enhance the overall efficiency of the system. The multinational team involved in its development was composed of five students, from five countries and fields of study. This paper covers their solution, involving overall design, the technology involved and the benefits it could bring to the current market. The team was able to achieve the final rendered Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings, successfully performed all the electronic testing, and designed a solution under budget. Furthermore, the solution presented was deeply studied from the sustainability viewpoint and the team also developed a product specific marketing plan. Finally, the students involved in this project obtained new knowledge and skills."
2024,An Instrument for Assessing Power Distance in Agile Organizations - Preliminary Results,"Mattos, Claudio Saraiva and Dutra, Eliezer and Santos, Gleison",10.1145/3701625.3701653,https://doi.org/10.1145/3701625.3701653,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the XXIII Brazilian Symposium on Software Quality,,"Background: Power Distance is defined as the degree of acceptance in relation to inequality of power among people. In agile organizations, high distance power can lead to restricted communication, reduced collaboration, and resistance to change, which can negatively affect the software quality. However, identifying latent behaviors associated with high power distance is not always straightforward. Objective: We present IDPD, an instrument to assess power distance in agile organizations whose measurement items are based on manifestations of power distance associated with human factors, organizational culture elements, and process-related elements. Method: We followed guidelines for developing psychometric scales. The IDPD was evaluated by an expert judge panel and in a case study in two agile teams. Results: The items were deemed easy to understand, relevant and adequate to evaluate power distance in agile settings. In general, the diagnosis provided in the case study showed little to no effect associated with high power distance on organizational culture elements and human factors. Conversely, high power distance may be impacting process execution and improvement. Conclusion: Initial evidence suggests that the IDPD supports the assessment of power distance in agile teams and provides insights for mitigating its impacts."

They have become a great tool in the learning process. However, the vast majority do not focus on vulnerable groups such as visually impaired people. On the other hand, the use of mobile devices has been growing and have become an important actor in the learning process, because there are many serious games developed for environments in this devices. Despite this, accessibility for visually impaired has not been considered as a necessary element in the development of this kind of video games. Some authors and companies of development of video games have proposed general guidelines that recommend for the construction of this type of applications. However, these initiatives have not been formalized so they need to be consolidated and analyzed to define a model for the accessibility assessment of video games oriented to people with visual impairments. This paper presents a compilation and analysis of accessibility guidelines for the development of video games for people with visual impairment. It also proposes a categorization of guidelines that can be used to analyze the level of accessibility of a video game and especially of serious games. As a case study, this categorization is used to evaluate some selected mobile serious games and identify their level of accessibility for people with visual impairment. We propose an analysis tool for those who wish to develop mobile serious games for the visually impaired."

A popular experiment in basic thermodynamics, both at a high-school and at University level, is the determination of the specific heat of solids and liquids using a water calorimeter, resourcing in many cases to a mercury thermometer. With our approach the analogical instrument is quickly turned into a digital device by analyzing the movement of the mercury with a video tracker. Thus, using very simple labware and the students' smartphones or tablets, it is possible to observe the decay behavior of the temperature of a liquid left to cool at room temperature. The dependence of the time constant with the mass and surface of the liquid can be easily probed, and the results of the different groups in the classroom can be brought together to observe the linear dependence1."

This also concerns the interaction with both virtual as well as real-life objects in cultural settings. Across different sectors, creating a complementary synthesis of the digital and analog has been a primary topic, particularly in the course of the 21st century. In this paper we aim to discuss the establishment of cultural innovation networks between museums and other sectors, exemplify potential links between digital and physical objects in connection with a current Digital Humanities project (exploreAT!) and shed light on user engagement possibilities opening towards open innovation research infrastructures (OI-RI)."

Traditional language learning methods often fail to provide sufficient practical opportunities, especially for diverse accents. To address this, we introduce Language Urban Odyssey (LUO), a serious game that leverages large language models (LLMs) and game-based learning to offer a low-cost, accessible virtual environment for English learners. Built on the Minecraft platform, LUO offers real-time speech interaction with NPCs of various accents, supported by multi-modal feedback. A controlled study (N=30) showed improvements in speaking abilities, accent comprehension, and emotional confidence. Our findings suggest that LUO provides a scalable, immersive platform that bridges gaps in language learning for immigrants facing cultural and social challenges."

The definition, development and deployment of this type of software solutions is complex and involves several problems identified and analyzed in previous works. In order to solve these problems, an architectural pattern based on Buschmann's Layers pattern has been defined. The accumulated experience developing learning ecosystems along with the problems analysis using Business Process Model and Notation and the architectural pattern, have provided a knowledge base to define an ecosystems metamodel. The proposed metamodel provides a framework for Model-Driven Development of learning ecosystems. The main objective of the present work is to validate the ecosystems metamodel from modeling a learning ecosystem."

Additionally, potential challenges were analyzed that are related to the lack of consistency and interoperability that may be present in different software implementations based on the OAIS model. As a result, this work suggests a preliminary study on the applicability of a software architecture based on a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for the Archival Storage and Access entities in the OAIS model. The aim is to promote more flexibility in the communication between different software implementations based on the OAIS model. The ultimate goal is to develop an interoperable and transparent way to digital content in this new era of contemporary society."

It is usually demanded by employers and is included in most of the Engineering Degree programme results. In addition, some decisions must be taken in order to integrate teamwork development in a curriculum. However, as with other non-specific competences, universal well-defined teamwork parameters are not available and taking proper decisions is not easy. In fact, some of these parameters depend on the context of the degree (specific discipline, beliefs of educators and students or available resources). Therefore, it would be a good practice to do some research on this context before taking decisions about the curriculum. This paper presents a qualitative approach for this kind of research carried out in a Telecommunication Engineering School. Ten educators were interviewed and the analysis of the obtained data allowed us to dig into certain characteristics of teamwork, like its definition, educator requirements to teach it or the reluctances of students and teachers to practise in that context. We have proposed some topics for future discussions that we hope can help to define the best way to develop this competence on degrees."

It addresses the evolutionary process of distance and semi-distance education in Cuba, the current transformations implemented by the Ministry of Higher Education, the technological conditions that Cuban universities have and the teaching practices of Cuban History. The type of work to be developed is descriptive. A mixed methodology will be used, applying ad-hoc instruments such as Likert-type surveys and in-depth interviews, which will be subjected to validity and reliability analysis through techniques such as expert consultation and the Crombach Alpha to surveys, and Kappa de Fleis in the case of the interviews. The aim of this work is to design a methodological strategy based on the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) that satisfies the training needs of university teachers, in order to teach the History of Cuba in a blended environment. A theoretical framework of great importance will be developed for the study of the blended-teaching evolution in Cuba, suggesting a new periodization stage in this process. It is hoped that the results obtained will positively influence in the methodological preparation of the professors, who play an important role in the current transformations of the Cuban Higher Education."

Implementing transdisciplinarity implies the creation of a common conceptual, theoretical and empirical structure among disciplines, therefore, its execution processes often offer interesting opportunities in educational research. This case study seeks to investigate the experience of a group of professionals from different disciplines who participated in the design of a xMOOC entitled ""Electrical Energy: Concepts and Basic Principles"", which is part of the Bi-National Laboratory on Smart Sustainable Energy Management and Technology Training, project financed by CONACYT-SENER's energy sustainability fund. This paper explores the challenges faced by team members to achieve the objectives of course design, investigating personal characteristics that determine the tendency of solutions or problems in the development of the course, and exploring the implications of their participation in further teaching and research practices. Using a variety of methods, including semi-structured interviews, recorded conversations (dialogue in interaction), field journals-Participant Observation and the analysis of official documents, it was found that the consequence of the joint work of multiple disciplines in a related project causes the absence of individualism, generating opportunities for revision, reflection and intellectual discussions that enrich both the contents and the learning environment. In this type of projects, sharing information was not the essence of collaboration, but the common understanding that evolves through dialogue, discussion, tolerance and consensus building. Although working in a transdisciplinary manner involved hard work when there was no clarity or hierarchy in the roles, when there were differences in terminology and domain models, or communication flaws, this type of projects produced synergistic effects which steered more efficient educational processes and products, fostering mutual support and leading to the transformation and improvement of teaching and research practices."

2017,Improvement of massive open online courses by text mining of students' emails: a case study,"Buena\~{n}o-Fern\'{a}ndez, Diego and Luj\'{a}n-Mora, Sergio and Villegas-Ch, W.",10.1145/3144826.3145393,https://doi.org/10.1145/3144826.3145393,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"In recent years, the constant increase in the number of online courses has led to radical changes in the education sector. These new online learning environments present a series of challenges that are difficult to manage using traditional methods. The challenges relate to the level of commitment and motivation shown by students on this type of course. Several articles have been identified from the analysed literature related to the application of text or opinion mining techniques for the analysis of comments made in social networks. In the educational field, articles related to the topic that focus on the analysis of opinion have been identified based on entries included in discussion forums for online courses. Many publications are geared towards solutions in the English language, and the nature of linguistic analysis of this type of study makes it necessary to adapt them for languages other than English. In this paper, we explore the opinion mining through text mining in emails from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC). The opinion mining expressed in emails is a complex task due to the thematic disparity of emails, their size and the depth of linguistic analysis required. The purpose of this study is to analyse students opinions about their courses, their instructors, and the main tools used on the course. The research focus on the calculation and analysis of the frequency of terms, the analysis of concordances, groupings and n-grams. The case study used in this paper is a MOOC on the topic of web development with more than 40,000 enrolled students."

Nowadays, the assessment and scoring carried out by groups of reviewers, namely evaluation of final year project or thesis works or even peer evaluation, are becoming more and more frequent. However, the assessment and scoring of a work in such scenarios can be affected by each rater's thinking processes, knowledge level and personal preferences among other issues. These idiosyncrasies are known as rater effects and can dramatically affect the evaluation process. Although many works point out that the use of certain evaluation instruments, e.g., evaluation rubrics, can increase the fairness and impartiality of the evaluation, rater effects may be still present and remarkably affect the scoring. Furthermore, some works might present controversy on their assessment, i.e., the evaluators of a certain work might strongly disagree on its quality. Therefore, the identification of the rater effects and controversial evaluations is crucial to be able to take remediation actions and to guarantee a fair evaluation. However, this identification process is often hard for scoring leaders. Consequently, tools that help leaders in this process are necessary. This paper presents the visualizations used by RaMon (a system for monitoring raters and controversial evaluations) to help the monitoring process, along with the support it provides to take remediation actions."

The solution is called The GreenHouse and is meant for people who live in small houses or city apartments and want fresh home grown aromatic plants, but have neither the time nor the space to grow them. The solution is intended to be sustainable and appropriate for people concerned with eating healthy, fresh food. The project was developed by a team of five students enrolled in the European Project Semester (EPS) at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP) during the spring of 2017. EPS@ISEP is a project-based learning framework which aims to foster personal, teamwork and multidisciplinary problem-solving skills in engineering, business and product design students. Research and discussions within the team were done to develop the product. The existing solutions for growing fresh food in industrial and domestic applications as well as marketing, sustainability and ethical topics were researched and discussed. This way it was possible to define the requirements of The GreenHouse. The GreenHouse is semi-automatic and requires little interaction from the customer. It has two covers, a winter cover and a summer cover, to be changed depending on the season and weather. Solar energy and rainwater are used to enable the growth of aromatic plants, making this a sustainable system. The support is adaptable and made to fit different support sizes so it can be hanged on balconies or windows."

The transmedia universe, currently becoming one of the most widely used generalist content dissemination strategies, has hardly any previous experiences in science communication. Its potential is enormous and to integrate it the scientist assumes a participant and active role in the transfer of knowledge to the society, spreading its work strategically by all communication media available. When it is time to study the role of the European scientist in this transmedia context, the first problem we encountered is its own implication. For this purpose, this study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technologies (UTAUT) model, which proposes that the intention to adopt technologies and the real adoption are positively influenced by the performance expectancy and negatively by the effort expectancy. We will investigate the current degree of media use through a questionnaire and will develop a group experiment with stimuli, to test the causality of the variables. The final objective of the research will be to know the effect of the variables on the actual use of the media and potentially to open new ways in scientific communication towards the scientific transmedia storytelling, as part of the work of the researchers, to reach a greater amount of public access to scientific knowledge."

To manage these data flows, data-driven ecosystems need high levels of interoperability, as it allows the collaboration and independence of both internal and external components. REST APIs are a common solution to achieve interoperability, but sometimes they lack flexibility and performance. The arising of GraphQL APIs as a flexible, fast and stable protocol for data fetching makes it an interesting approach for data-intensive and complex data-driven (eco)systems. This paper outlines the GraphQL protocol and the benefits derived from its use, as well as it presents a case of study of the improvement experienced by the Observatory of Employment and Employability (also known as OEEU) ecosystem after including GraphQL as main API in several components. The results of the paper show promising improvements regarding the flexibility, maintainability and performance, among other benefits."

The European Commission launched the Europe 2020 strategy in 2010 to tackle the transformation of Europe and the world since the beginning of the 21st Century. The main objective of the strategy was to prepare the European Community for the major challenges of the decade and, among the various development and innovation actions, also the creation of an infrastructure in the hybrid or federalized cloud model that would meet the computing needs of these institutions linked to science and research. In this work, we examine the circumstances that led the European Union to create the EOSC. We also present the main characteristics that are part of the concepts of cloud computing, such as the consolidation and dynamic use of shared computational resources. We conclude that the creation of cloud computing infrastructure for scientific research for the European Union is a strategic need for the region and that many technical and social challenges should be considered for its implementation, the latter being the most relevant for the current panorama."

Firstly, it is provided an overview of the state of the art of the research on libraries' impact in the Spanish education context. Secondly, a statistical analysis is conducted by using the datasets released from the international student assessment surveys, as an attempt to measure and confirm the effect of school libraries on students' scoring. With a quantitative empirical approach, the paper seeks to test the influence of the library as a predictive variable for achievement results in international reading assessments. Framework and datasets released from PISA 2009 and PIRLS 2011 surveys are used as a source for the statistical analysis. The systematic procedure for data selection, together with variables operationalization are explained. Then, possible associations between variables are explored. The results suggest statistically significant evidences of the positive impact of school libraries on students' reading scoring at secondary school. Finally, the paper explores those limitations concerning the analysis at primary school. Therefore, further research issues are suggested. This work is part of an ongoing doctoral research which is focused on the impact assessment of libraries in learning contexts."

Reviewing existing literature on AI applications in science, engineering, arts, and more, it brings forth unique contributions to progress in each area. This paper will research cross-national disparities in the development of AI talent, how educational policies, as well as industrial demands, impact training. A mixed-method approach is used in the analysis, with data and case studies from various countries to understand AI talent development. AI applications vary across countries and fields, exposing gaps in policy and education. Advanced countries invest in AI healthcare research to take the lead in sophisticated diagnostic systems. It is in developing countries where AI helps most: increased productivity in agriculture. The priority and resources will be dictated by local needs. Education and its resources and initiatives are in place for talent development, guiding policymakers and industry leaders on how to develop AI. This will develop the expertise necessary for advancing global AI technology. For example, in the area of education, enough resources can be put in place to ensure that students are abreast of state-of-the-art facilities and knowledge. Interdisciplinary initiatives, such as the integration of computer science with psychology or sociology, can yield a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between artificial intelligence and human behavior as well as social structures. By acknowledging these factors, it is essential to formulate strategies that foster an ecosystem conducive to the growth of AI expertise and propel international advancements in AI technology."

We describe a 30-month community-engaged case study to surface design challenges at this intersection, creating Wordplay, an accessible, multilingual platform for youth to program interactive typography. Wordplay combines functional programming, multilingual text, multimodal editors, time travel debugging, and teacher- and youth-centered community governance. Across five 2-hour focus group sessions, a group of 6 multilingual students and teachers affirmed many of the platform’s design choices, but reinforced that design at the margins was unfinished, including support for limited internet access, decade-old devices, and high turnover of device use by students with different access, language, and attentional needs. The group also highlighted open source platforms like GitHub as unsuitable for engaging youth. These findings suggest that EPLs that are both accessible and language-inclusive are feasible, but that there remain many design tensions between language design, learnability, accessibility, culture, and governance."

In 2015, messaging apps have surpassed social networks. In this context, chat-bots or bots, are a new kind of applications that leverage these messaging ecosystem advantages. They need no installation effort, they are ubiquitous and they reside in students' most valuable gadgets, their smartphones. Armed with AI techniques, machine learning algorithms and natural language processing features, bots could be an ideal teacher assistant, able to answer and propose personalized questions to the students, anywhere, anytime. But before that near future arrives, there is a need for designing a new breed of mobile learning applications that take advantage of the ubiquity of these bots for everyday use. In this article we present the design and implementation of a Telegram bot, @dawebot, for training students in any subject using multiple choice question quizzes. We also present an evaluation of @dawebot in a 15 week long subject with 23 students of Computer Science, documenting their opinion about this bot in particular and the usage of bots in the elearning area in general. Students think that using bots for practicing tests is a good idea (89%), that using testing bots could help them to engage more in the subject (72%) and and will definitely recommend to use such testing bots also in other subjects of their university grade (94%)."

Three main lines of analysis were developed, the first of which was used to analyze the main elements defining the incorporation of youth into the sphere of digital technologies. The second interpretive framework looked at the role of social media in youth's construction of identity, and at the opportunities and main problems associated with their management of their intimate, private, and public lives. The third line of analysis looked in greater detail at the differences in use, appropriation, and incorporation of interconnected youth, based on social categories such as gender, media diet, political capital, or educational path that would act as social mediators in their virtual experience. Lastly, a number of conclusions were drawn emphasizing that young hyperconnected individuals live their experience of socialization and identity construction on the Network in a complex way, noting, nonetheless, that social networks can be an opportunity for the construction of social ties and development of democratic societies."

A wide variety of computer algorithms, such as image processing techniques, classification systems and artificial intelligence approaches, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), have been used in this field. CAD applications have extended to an increasing number of image modalities, as for example radiography, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) and to a great number of diseases, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, Alzheimer's disease, spine cancer, aneurysm, interstitial lung diseases... In this paper, a review of the fundamentals of some of these CAD systems, with special emphasis on those schemes based on ANNs, will be conducted. An analysis of methods and results obtained in clinical practice and a report of the advantages derived from its use (mainly focused in mammography, thoracic and colonic CT) will also be presented. In the last section, a compilation of CAD papers related with medical education and specialists' training reveals that this area has not been developed by many researchers. CAD schemes with educational purposes have been created for learning patterns in error making by radiology trainees, identifying regions where false positive detection is more probable, and predicting case difficulty for improving the learning process. The use of Computer Aided Education related with CAD software and Content-based image retrieval techniques have also been utilized as methods for enhancing learning."

However, schools do not use this method, despite it being the most intuitive and simple one in the initial levels of music education. Therefore the aim of this study is to develop an innovative and different instructional sequence to the traditional method used in musical training centres, and to prove its usefulness in the performance of sight-reading. To carry out the study, we made an exploratory test that involved students and teachers of the Conservatory of Music of Villalba. After its implementation, it can be concluded that the instructional modification does improve the results of sight-reading."

For this reason, a mechanism to maintain motivation when research is not going well or to help students get on track with research when they have just been assigned to a laboratory could be useful. Students that have just begun their research may not yet understand how to proceed. In this research, we have developed a research activity concierge (RAC) system, which is a platform to encompass general research activities, and applied gamification to this system to keep motivation high. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of the RAC system on the action setting and motivation and analyzed operational logs to improve usability."
2016,Fostering teacher development using simple technologies to listen and respond to accounts of learning from experience,"Russell, Tom",10.1145/3012430.3012592,https://doi.org/10.1145/3012430.3012592,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"This paper illustrates and explains four simple technologies used to introduce individuals enrolled in a pre-service teacher education program to ways of documenting their professional learning. Each technology provides a way of listening to a teacher candidate's account of professional learning experiences with a view to responding in ways that support and encourage skills of reflection-in-action and learning from experience. The context for these data is a pre-service course on the teaching of physics at the secondary level. There are usually 15 to 20 students in the course that is part of a teacher preparation program at Queen's University leading to a Bachelor of Education degree and certification as a teacher in the province of Ontario. The methodology is self-study of teacher education practices, as I review my comments to students with a view to identifying more productive ways of responding to their accounts of their professional learning. The excerpts selected to illustrate the four technologies are rich in opportunities for reframing of experience. Analysis of my responses to students suggests the need to attend more closely and carefully to their moments of reframing."

Although its characters, called Champions, can be purchased with actual (or ingame) money, there is a weekly rotation of ten free champions where players can test new champions before buying them. When new content is launched or a Champion is changed or reworked, players react to that by either using that Champion more or less (depending on whether they perceive it as positive or negative). Additionally, from time to time, Special Events are launched. The Bilgewater event, ""Burning Tides"", is one of such events, the only one that happened in season five, that aimed to merge lore with gameplay and represented Riot most ambitious story-telling experiment to date. Moreover, the seven Champions that had its background tied to Bilgewater were added to the free rotation on top of the other ten during the event, so there was no economic limiting factor that could hinder players from using them. This paper aims to understand how an event such as Bilgewater impact players in two dimensions; first, whether special events have an impact in Champion Usage and second, whether lore events can have an impact in player's motivation to read and learn in League of Legends. Results show that the effect in Champion Usage is unclear, with other factors being more relevant than Special Events, but that lore events have the potential to drive motivation to read and learn about the Champions and their story, events or optimal builds in the game, with a clear peak of interest in them."

During the design and development of this type of software we have realized the existing modeling approaches were not well suited for the modeling of JSF or ASP.NET MVC applications. This paper extends UML for the modeling of the presentation tier of enterprise applications based on JSF or ASP.NET MVC frameworks. Our main aim was to include navigational, structural and role-based access control (RBAC) elements for JSF/ASP.NET MVC applications in UML class and sequence diagrams built according to multitier patterns. Accordingly, our approach: (i) characterizes the navigational, structural and RBAC elements of JSF/ASP.NET MVC frameworks; (ii) does not define a proprietary notation but provides two platform-specific UML profiles that extend UML-WAE; (iii) is able to include any multitier, service-oriented architecture and security design-level pattern in the models; (iv) provides models whose semantics can be directly translated into code; and therefore, (v) decouples code maintenance from specific tools. This approach has been successfully used in the design of a complex e-learning web application deployed by our research group."

It employs the methodology of the systematic mapping of the literature using the Science Direct, Springer Open and Google Scholar academic databases. The most significant findings include a tendency for social innovation laboratories using different technologies to socialize knowledge and the use of collaboration tools for the collaborative construction of knowledge. Is has been found that the creation of citizen networks (open social networks, researcher networks or contributor networks) and interdisciplinary work groups is common. Experts in laboratories suggest participating in listening mode since they take into account the experience of those affected and non-experts. Therefore, social innovation labs are spaces that are open to proposals for designing a work plan involving a range of actors to prototype a proposal from the perspective of open innovation."

The main objectives of the thesis are the following ones: to know and to analyse the primary school teachers' (in service) attitudes and the future primary school teachers' (at initial training) attitudes towards collaborative learning with video games; to design, implement and assess an educational proposal about collaborative learning with video games for the future primary school teachers (at initial training), including the use of video games and the creation of video games with software that is not necessary to have previous programming knowledge. In terms of methodology, our research is divided into two studies to reach the two main objectives. On the one hand, to reach the first objective, we chose an ex post facto approach. On the other hand, the second study, related to the other objectives, is inside of program evaluation methodologies. In particular, we chose a pretest-postest design with an only group. The instruments to collect data in the studies are an attitude scale towards collaborative learning with video games, a knowledge test about collaborative learning with video games, an assessment questionnaire about the educational proposal and a rubric to assess the video games created by the future primary school teachers. Finally, regarding the results achieved until now, we created and validated the scale and we are going to validate the knowledge test. Furthermore, we designed the educational proposal and we are looking for students to be the sample and to participate in the implementation of the proposal."

Nevertheless, with the Bologna Process reforms and the economic constraints most Higher Education Institutions face nowadays, caused a significant decline in the amount of time devoted to hands-on lab. Researchers are seeking complementary ways to teach these practical skills and recently, with the explosive popularity of computer-based learning, remote labs are being used as an option. This review paper presents a first attempt to compile empirical studies that directly report the use of the remote laboratory VISIR (Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality). These practices of engineering classes/courses, used VISIR individually or as a complement to traditional hands on laboratory. Concerning these different approaches of how VISIR is used, the authors draw several conclusions - findings suggest that VISIR is a useful learning instrument, having been used, so far, by more than 4400 students. It contributes to improve students' competences and knowledge, their confidence in lab and their enthusiasm and motivation. Some factors, such as teacher's supervision and attention to the VISIR component play a crucial role in students' engagement. Finally, the results achieved through this review raise several important and still non studied issues to be addressed by future research."

By means of the dynamic contents of the command Manipulate this initiative tries to improve the comprehension of some algebraic contents related with the Euclidean geometry, more specifically, the relative position of two or three straight lines on the plane. To achieve this objective, it has been developed a specific procedure divided into two parts. The first of them allows students to fix the parameters of a straight line on the plane and to modify dynamically (by using a cursor) the parameters of a second straight line between some pre-specified values, which can also be modified by the user. Both lines are represented simultaneously on a window, which offers immediate information about the relative position, and which also gives the value of the distance between the lines if they are parallel, or the coordinates of their common point if they cross. In a second step, the procedure has been extended to fix two straight lines and to visualize and analyze dynamically the behavior of a third line and its relative position with respect to the previous two lines. This proposal aims to help teachers of mathematics to make their students to have a better understanding of these algebraic concepts: it allows visualizing the consequences of variations in any of the parameters of a straight line, and obtains dynamically and immediately the relative positions of two or more straight lines."

These techniques cover a heterogeneous range, from manual expert analysis using computer methods (usually by annotation systems), to the application of natural language processing algorithms or discourse analysis techniques, which are able to identify cognitive relationships between text elements, e.g. causal structures or contrasts argumentations. This advancement is more evident in humanities research contexts, where most of the knowledge generated are expressed in textual formats. However, how the use of these techniques is affecting the analysis conducted by researchers in humanities' texts? Is it possible to measure the quality of the textual analysis? What kind of cognitive structures are identified in the text using these methods?This paper presents an empirical study conducted with humanities researchers, with the goal of obtaining a better understanding about how texts in digital contexts are analyzed by these professionals using semiautomatic discourse analysis techniques. The paper also proposes a method, based on Thinking Aloud protocols, in order to design experiments and evaluate software cognitive aspects, such as digital textual analysis, with humanities professionals. Finally, the paper discusses about how empirical studies and the Thinking Aloud method constitute a solid basis to better understand the relationship between expert textual analysis in humanities and it conducting using software methods."

The research question specifically aims at measuring the relationship between the impact of challenge-based gamification in online teaching on the level of educative innovation in terms of solving problems related to sustainable energy. This dissertation is part of the Strategic Initiative of Energy Project that was started by the National Council for Science and Technology in Mexico (CONACYT), the Energy Ministry (SENER) and the Tecnol\'{o}gico de Monterrey, which aims for massive training on the topics of energy and sustainability. For this purpose, there are being designed ten MOOCs (massive open online courses), which should include innovative teaching strategies such as gamification and challenge based learning. The gamification is an innovative educational strategy whose purpose is to place the student in scenarios or simulations involving achieving attractive challenges so as to increase their level of commitment (engagement) and competitiveness. Around 1,000 participants will take the MOOC and will constitute the study sample of this study. Questionnaires, open-ended interviews, and challenge-base learning tasks will be delivered to participants. A mixed method research analysis for both quantitative and qualitative data will be conducted. Intended results may probably point to differences between those participants who use gamification and those who do not in terms of being more successful in solving real-life energy problems. At present, only the theoretical framework and the instruments have been developed."

One approach to identify difficult concepts is to capture students’ confusion during class time. However, most existing confusion detectors focus on an individual student rather than a classroom, and only on a single ethnicity group which could propagate bias when developing pedagogical technologies. In this paper, we leverage two existing ‘Confused’ facial expression datasets (DAiSEE and DevEmo) with an East Asian ‘Confused’ facial expression dataset that we collected. Through model performance and explainableAI, we address potential cultural biases in detecting emotions, particularly in confusion, and identified culturally-specific features that align with prior research. As a proof-of-concept, we deployed this cross-cultural confusion machine learning model in a live semester-long class. This work to integrate cross-cultural facial features highlights the importance of fostering inclusivity in educational technologies."

Studies have shown that various psychosocial factors affect risky sexual behavior. Lack of information and poor access to sexual and reproductive healthcare service, an early start to sexual activity, impulsivity, and perceived invulnerability, among others. Interesting results have also been found on the effects that persuasive narrative produce through educational and entertainment videos for changes in attitudes and intention of risky behavior in the area of health. And separately media literacy has been studied as a factor in the level of critical skills used by teens, which makes them more critical in the face of media products that try and convince them of something, but what has not been studied is how being media competent affects their mediation of persuasive arguments in the field of communication on healthcare. The objective of this study is to determine if the level of media literacy mitigates the impact of two videos, narrative and non-narrative, how that impacts their attitude, knowledge, and intentional behavior to prevent unwanted pregnancy, and the perceived vulnerability, counter-argumentation will also be considered, transport and identification with characters as variable mitigating factors. Experimental research will be applied to adolescent women. The results are intended to be used to show the efficacy of the messages in pregnancy prevention videos are key to be considered in healthcare campaigns for sexual and reproductive health in adolescents."

One of their chief merits is retaining the learning motivation and engagement of players during all time of the game. Therefore, it is necessary educational games to be able to adjust their features such as task difficulty, object speed, learning content, etc. according to the current emotional state of the player and, as well, to his/her playing style. In this paper, we present a dynamic mechanism for affective game adaptation based on both emotion and arousal estimation. The mechanism is implemented within an applied video game named ""Rush for Gold"" designed for implicit recognition of playing or learning styles. The paper outlines, analyzes and discusses results of an experimental study related to player's engagement in affective applied adaptation."

Thereby, it is essential to incorporate computing updated training and development systems taking for granted that online training is becoming a very useful tool nowadays. This is complemented with the National Development Plan [24] which mentions that ""education, understood the as development and training at different levels and cycles, is essential to strengthen and diversify the capacities and individual and social potentialities, to promote a participatory and critic citizenship"" [27]. This research presents the results of a study carried out at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito, with the assistance of the Council for Higher Education to implement a methodology for massive training of Civil Servants of Ecuador in the context of education through a virtual course called ""Virtual Learning Environments"", which was issued at national level in Ecuador. In order to conduct this research, a guiding methodology was established to set up the content planning as well as the instructional design to obtain a virtual course structured in the MOOC platform requiring monitoring and evaluation of students and the technical and educational team as well. The sample consists of 310 teachers nationwide. The results are intended to establish the use of virtual learning environments by teachers who work at different universities in the country. In the case of this course, the current emphasis is placed on pre-production process being a key element in the success of MOOC. Therefore, the evaluation of quality starts from the very first steps. In this case, it refers to a MOOC that uses a Neuro-linguistic Programming base (NLP) and it will be screened by reverse instruction, assuming that the diagnostic of the initiating user's capabilities and skills is relevant to schedule the needed resources."
2016,Analysis of the use and design of rubrics in competency assessment in engineering degrees,Leticia-Concepci\'{o}n and Velasco-Mart\'{\i}nez and Juan-Carlos and T\'{o}jar-Hurtado,10.1145/3012430.3012514,https://doi.org/10.1145/3012430.3012514,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"The defining, implementation and assessment of competencies are challenges for new undergraduate and Master's degrees which must respond to current education demands. The use of rubrics in universities is considered an instrument of innovation and educational change that transforms assessment practices, both for students and educators. Furthermore, new education, focusing on the development of student competencies, implies a profound modification, not only of assessment approaches, but also of the approach towards education, instruction and teaching. Since their appearance in the university environment, the application of competencies in assessment systems has progressively grown. But, there is yet to be a solid body of knowledge providing evidence of the use of rubrics by educators as assessment instruments. In this study, rubrics have been analysed in 50 educators from the engineering departments of distinct Spanish universities. The rubrics used represent a wide variety of courses and university centres. A comparative analysis allows us to determine how these rubrics are being used (or not) to assess competencies. To do so, the type of works and tasks to which they are applied has been revealed, as well as the technical and pedagogical aspects that are considered by the educators in their design. The results and conclusions allow us to detect the educational needs of the teaching staff that hopes to use rubrics to assess competencies."

In virtual environments it also guides teachers as to the effectiveness of their activity and academic officers as to the system for teaching appraisal. This paper presents a proposal to measure and analyse the quality of virtual teaching. It comprises a two-dimensional quality model implemented on a web tool. The model unifies and organises the criteria for quality of virtual teaching, scattered across virtual teaching quality models, into a two-dimensional structure that enables a multi-aspect interpretation of quality metrics. Application of the tool is facilitated through the provision of a semiautomatic system to measure quality, represent results for analysis, and manage multiple users and assessments. It constitutes a new approach that integrated partial solutions already tested to improve, recognise, and appraise the effectiveness of virtual teaching."

However, from a psychometric point of view, CT is still a poorly defined psychological construct: there is no full consensus on a formal definition of CT or how to measure it; and its correlations with other psychological constructs, whether cognitive or non-cognitive, have not been completely established. In response to the latter, this paper aims to study specifically the correlations between CT and the several dimensions from the 'Big Five' model of human personality: Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. To do so, the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) and the Big Five Questionnaire-Children version (BFQ-C) are administered on a sample (n = 99) of Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade. Results show statistically significant correlations between CT and: Openness to Experience (r = 0.41), Extraversion (r = 0.30), and Conscientiousness (r = 0.27). These results are partially consistent with the literature about the links between cognitive and personality variables, and corroborate the existence of a non-cognitive side of CT. Hence, educational interventions aimed at fostering CT should take into account these non-cognitive issues in order to be comprehensive and successful."

It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better ""logical thinking"") is applicable not only to STEM subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited to decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called ""moral machines"", using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behaviours under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will have to deal also with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as part of de difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a ""right"" versus ""wrong"" answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences."

Its importance is that some scholars suggest that digital skills are a prevention tool against the risks of digital technologies. These risks are especially important because of their psychological consequences on adolescents. Thus, digital literacy could be a health prevention tool. The purpose of this research was to develop and validate a scale to assess digital literacy on teenagers. A self-report questionnaire with 47 items measured in a 5-point Likert scale was developed. After a pilot study, the questionnaire was administered to a sample composed by 715 secondary school students from 13 schools in Spain, aged between 12 and 20 years. Exploratory factor analysis revealed the existence of six factors: technological skill, personal security skill, critical skill, devices security skill, informational skill and communication skill. The scale demonstrated support for internal consistency reliability in most of the factors, with Cronbach's Alpha levels ranging from .63 to .75, and validity. Further research is needed to confirm the factor structure."

Media literacy, which is understood as a holistic concept of literacy enriched by different literacies needed in this century, has the leading role in this context. Even though European stakeholders, policy makers and international institutions have been working for a common framework, key indicators in media literacy are a continuously changing set of competences that evolve rapidly with technological and digital transformation.In this regard this essay presents an in depth study of international indicators in media literacy in its most relevant contexts. Due to the changing nature of the indicators, it is important to keep updated on the latest achievements that different institutions and governments have reached. Particularly significant is the study of the European framework, with special attention focused on work carried out in the United Kingdom. UNESCO also served as a pioneers in expanding and developing media literacy and media education. Finally, ACMA dimensions for media literacy from Australia allow us to draw an updated road map of media literacy in the knowledge society. The main conclusion refers to the multidimensional meaning of media literacy deduced from the study of different contexts, which is the starting point for a real study of media literacy today."

This exploratory research applies to students from the last year of first cycle graduation from Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP) and it is based in the results of two similar questionnaires handed to students in two different moments: before starting and after completing the internship. Different items were classified by the students in a scale from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). The study considered a group of 44 students and refers to one academic year (2015/16). The results show that the students' expectations before starting the internship are globally very high (medians 4 and 5, for all items). Students' conclusions about real achievements (after ending the internship) are quite close to initial expectations, but for ten of 22 items, statistical differences were observed. In all these cases, the observed differences reflect only a slight decrease in the scores. This exploratory study confirms that the internship allows the students a better awareness of personal, technical and soft skills (self-evaluation) as well as of that first professional experience outcomes. Self-evaluation and real achievements are still very positively classified by the students after the internship, confirming the importance of this experience in their formation."

These students attended a programming session designed to applied computational principles in different fields. We have analyzed how this acceptance varies with age, and also if their opinion changes if they were exposed to a real robot teacher or not. To this end, participants (N=210) were divided in two groups, one was lectured by a teacher and the other one by a Baxter robot. We used the Negative Attitudes towards Robots Scale and the Robot Anxiety Scale questionnaires to evaluate students' perception. Statistical analysis of the answers to these questionnaires is discussed in the paper, both taking into account the whole groups and another considering three subgroups based on age. Main conclusion of the study is that the use of the robot is relevant in the perception of the students about robots, but also that age is significant in the perception of robots as potential teachers."

Current research shows that the number of students with lack of academic achievement in mathematics is significant. In the case of Discrete Mathematics, it learning increases its difficulty due to various motivational, attitudinal and ability variables. Hence, the need of promoting academic proposals that raises the levels of engagement of students towards the learning of the subject.The present research project aims to assess the effects of an e- textbook on the engagement towards the learning of Discrete Mathematics in university students. A quasi-experimental quantitative methodology is used. It will begin in a first phase with the application of a questionnaire to measure the levels of engagement of students with the learning of Discrete Mathematics. Likewise, the levels of satisfaction of students and teachers with the study materials of Discrete Mathematic will be measured.A second phase will propose the design of an e-textbook as educational material. The results of the research will show the impact of the e-textbook elaborated in the engagement towards the learning of Discrete Mathematics, by a questionnaire applied to students who used the developed material.The expected results will widely allow the design of educational materials to enhance the engagement of other issues in different teaching scenario, which will be useful to improve the academic performance of the students in those subjects where the results are not the desired ones and it affects, therefore, the university quality standards."

Nevertheless, several authors indicate that there are still insufficient evidences on the levels of participation that students have on their own evaluation process, nor do we see the presence of evaluation practices that show the application of an authentic formative and shared evaluation in relation to the acquisition of competences. Thus, it follows that engineering faculty does not employ patterns of action that are sufficiently transparent and explicit to promote student interest and understanding. The objective of the study was to validate a measurement instrument that would allow evaluating the transparency of the methods and evaluation strategies employed by the educators of the Engineering degrees. The pilot study, applied to 50 students of Engineering has been analysed through a principal components categorical analysis (CATPCA). The seven components in which the model has been structured show as many relevant dimensions that reflect the factorial structure of the questionnaire: transparency, level of information about score, evaluation modalities, feedback from teachers, resources and educational agents, procedures, strategies and Guidelines; and material resources that educators use."

It has now a central role in the field of teaching, but there is an extensive experience in the field of research. This evaluation method implies an author reviewing, usually anonymously, the work of his or her colleagues who, in turn, can become reviewers of the author's work. This peer evaluation system enriches the evaluation itself, and it can even become one of the few ways to assess the works in absence of a hierarchical authority on the subject. In massive access learning platforms it has even become the main assessment method. All in all, it is necessary to assure the quality of the assessment process. In this research we consider the process of peer review as a classification process, in which we have several classifiers (reviewers) that, before an input (work to revise) should assign a particular class (work grading). In this analysis two performance measures are proposed to assess the degree of goodness of the reviewers, in order to help improve the quality of peer review processes providing a more objective assessment of the reviewers task."

Manuel Sol\'{o}rzano Barruso Foundation of the University of Salamanca, analyzes search, access and consumption patterns related to scientific journals within the academic community of the University of Salamanca (USAL), in order to determine the degree of technological literacy within the institution, and its application in teaching, learning or research. Similarly, there are targeted some of the underlying causes of observed behavior patterns. An online e-survey is held through Google Drive's questionnaire tool, collecting a statistically representative sample of the population: students and teaching and research staff of the University of Salamanca. Access to scientific information through electronic journals is already the majority choice within the university community, although there are significant behaviour differences in relation to aspects such as membership in a particular branch of knowledge, role within academic community or perceived levels of reliability. In any case, technological literacy deficiencies are found, that prevent, at least, use and digital consumption experience improvement related to available resources."

This paper presents this point of view of students from several Engineering Degrees about how some generic competences should be trained and how this is currently addressed. Besides, self-perception of proficiency level in these generic competences has been assessed. We have used a survey methodology and the obtained results allow us to narrow down the focus on the role of the degree in training competences and the need of assess student skills before changing the curriculum. In a future work, these results will be contrasted with teachers' point of view in the framework of an overall research that is also briefly described."

Also, check what kinds of pedagogical knowledge emerge under different situations of reflection (individual reflection, reflection peer tutor and reflection). This research arises from the European Project (ACTTEA 2012-2015) which foremost purpose is to know how pre-service teachers learn from their practicum experience, that is to say, what kind of practical knowledge they activate when they engage in practical teaching situations. Eighty-eight Student Teachers participated in this study for Spain. Similar samples were gathered in the other partner countries: Finland, The Netherlands and Estonia. The analysis was carried out on three levels that are progressively more accurate: the first analysis is to analyze (both positive and negative) critical incidents that students get their recordings and categorize the most common issues. A second thematic analysis in which three main types of knowledge produced by teachers in training through reflection is identified: narrative knowledge (memories and rating); inferential knowledge (rules and artifacts) and explanatory knowledge (practical and theoretical justifications). And finally it carried out a propositional analysis for the purpose of dividing the speech smallest possible semantic units, which are what we call propositions. Currently, they have collected and analyzed all project data and is developing the theoretical framework."

It should have involved a profound rethinking of the teaching process of professors. Given the importance of teaching methodologies in the new higher education framework, we have researched by analysing the official documents -the teaching guides- of all the technical degrees and master degrees of all Universities in Galicia -Spain- that contain any subject related to Technical Drawing in order to find out which teaching methods are used. The results indicate that the variety of methodological strategies used is low, and the traditional lecture teaching methodology is the most used. It shows that professors have not adapted their methodologies to the demands of EHEA; therefore, it is concluded that a profound renewal of the teaching strategies of Technical Drawing professors of the Galician Universities is necessary and urgent."
2016,An approach to Spanish primary school teachers' attitudes towards collaborative learning with video games and the influence of teacher training,"del Pozo, Marta Mart\'{\i}n and G\'{o}mez-Pablos, Ver\'{o}nica Basilotta and Mu\~{n}oz-Repiso, Ana Garc\'{\i}a-Valc\'{a}rcel",10.1145/3012430.3012597,https://doi.org/10.1145/3012430.3012597,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"Teachers' attitudes and teacher training are two of the main factors to integrate a new technology or a new methodology in the classroom. In that sense, although there is a lot of literature about using video games in education and about their educational possibilities, teachers' attitudes can influence the application of video games as an educational resource. For that reason, in this paper we are going to focus on teacher attitudes and teacher training, in particularly, of in-service primary school teachers. Also, we are going to focus on collaborative learning with video games, topic that is explained in the paper. Regarding specific objectives, they are the followings: (1) to know the attitudes of primary school teachers (in-service) towards collaborative learning with video games, (2) to know if they have received previous educational training about video games in education and (3) to know if there is any statistically significant difference due to the fact of having received training or not about this topic. To reach these objectives and to show the results, this paper has been divided into four parts. The first part, introduction, deals with literature about video games and education. The second part is about the method of our study, including the instrument and the process to collect data. The third part shows the results of the study and the fourth part includes the conclusions of our research. Finally, in summary, we can say that primary school teachers have a positive attitude towards collaborative learning with video games. However, most of them say that they have not received teacher training about video games and education and this fact is influencing their attitudes, so teachers who have received training about that have better attitudes that teacher who have not received this kind of training."

The result is a collection of several studies published in the last six years. In them, it is showed that the main purpose of accelerometer sensor is to capture data from user context or from the device itself. These data are used for two purposes: first, to facilitate the user-device interaction, and second, as essential factor to the operation of the applications. Most common types of applications that use both possibilities in learning processes with smartphones are augmented reality (RA) environments and serious games."

The application field chosen for a proof of concept is surgery. A complete surgery is not a simple task and involves different skills to be combined in the right way and in the right order. Existing simulators in surgery field are focused on one specific task to train one particular skill, such as needle insertion or suturing. They are usually developed as stand-alone applications based on frameworks that manage the synchronization of the graphic and haptic parts, integrate physics engines and offer support for the most common haptic devices available in the market. But there are no standardized APIs that let developers easily increase the complexity of the simulators, neither let them include expertise knowledge. In order to solve this problem, we have previously defined a model for representing surgery procedures. This architecture encapsulates the surgeon expertise in order to use simulators as teaching/learning tools. In this work, HCore is presented as the middle layer of this architecture. Our goal is to offer a simplified interface as a step forward rapid haptic simulators development and, at the same time, provide independency from the particular game engine used in the lower layer."

Throughout this new educational stage, the work of the academic tutor (or advisor) is essential for guiding and accompanying the student. This process should help to prevent problems such as the frustration and insecurity that can appear, mainly among students in the early stages of their studies and usually after the first tests. In this context, resources and techniques from the field of coaching are very useful for the tutor, as those resources influence the student to reflect and be more aware of the situation in which he/she is living. The objective of these processes is for the student to be more qualified to take the appropriate decisions with greater discretion, motivation and responsibility. This paper presents a first approach in the process of applying coaching techniques in the tutoring of students in their first course of engineering, and subsequently presents the design, at the functional level of a technological application, that would make it possible to use resources of the coaching to tutors without a deep formation in coaching."

To this end, we selected a sample of students from the University of Salamanca to collect data through a questionnaire. These data have been analyzed following a quantitative methodology, a non-experimental method of descriptive type. The data obtained are proof of the positive perception of students towards the MD, of their interest and willingness in managing them in the academic and professional contexts, but also the intuitive component of its actual use and lack of training in the use thereof. With this information, our prospective work is now focused on promoting a greater presence of these devices in university classrooms, as well as increasing the training in the educational use of them."

In University courses related to Computer Sciences, this subject is sometimes trained through interviews with real companies. However, voluntaries of companies participating in the interviews do not act like real interlocutors, as their interest is not the project itself, but just the interview. In this regard, we miss custom dynamics such as conflicts or demanding requests, which are inherent parts of interviews. To include these conditions for a more realistic experience, we propose the students themselves to also take the role of clients, randomly playing different characters that are based on a set of features that define their personalities and technical skills. In this way, teams of analysts interview teams of customers, generating scenarios not only derived from the project requirements, but also the personal and strategic interests of each part. Results show that the main problems of analysts to handle meetings are precisely related to the emotional behaviors, which influenced quality, fluency, empathy and appropriateness in the analyst's conduct. Moreover, results show that after this experience the students achieved a strong improvement of abilities to dynamically manage an interview process, self-control skills, adequately express their ideas and anticipate client needs, compared to those who performed classical pre-designed interviews with real costumers. Students reported a gain of auto-assessment and a better empathy with clients, which increased the chances to successfully capture and prioritize requirements."

An instrument is considered adequate, among others criteria, when it is submitted a psychometric test, which allows assessing its validity and reliability. This research presents the results of the analysis for an Evaluation Tool of Reusable Learning Objects (Herramienta de Evaluaci\'{o}n de Objetos Did\'{a}cticos de Aprendizaje Reutilizables, HEODAR). The tests show an elevated reliability in the elements of each category of the questionnaire. The results of the factor analysis indicate that there is sufficient evidence to opt for a one-dimensional factor solution type for the scales. Items with low weights are not relevant, so they could be excluded, restructured or integrated into a new factor."
2016,Determining factors in acceptance of ICT by the university faculty in their teaching practice,"Cazco, Gustavo Homero Orozco and Gonz\'{a}lez, Marcos Cabezas and Abad, Fernando Mart\'{\i}nez and Altamirano, Jorge Edwin Delgado and Maz\'{o}n, Mar\'{\i}a Eugenia Sol\'{\i}s",10.1145/3012430.3012509,https://doi.org/10.1145/3012430.3012509,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"Information Communications Technology (ICT) has, little by little, infiltrated educational environments but without reaching the expectations of it's stakeholders. For this reason, the objective of this study is to determine the factors that influence the use and acceptance of ICT within the faculty of the Universidad Nacional de Chimborazo in their teaching practice. A quantitative approach was taken with a non-experimental, cross-sectional design of a correlational and descriptive nature. For this study, an instrument made up of 50 items, themselves divided into 10 dimensions (technological, pedagogical, techno-pedagogical, axiological, academic management, perception of usefulness, ease of use, intent of use, frequency of use and enabling conditions) was applied to a sample of 178 professors. The results obtained show that the Digital Competences and the Institutional Support have a significantly positive impact both in perception of usefulness and perception of ease of use. The principal conclusion shows the importance of Digital Competences that the faculty should have in order to use and accept ICT in their teaching practice."
2016,A development environment to customize assessment through students interaction with multimodal applications,"Balderas, Antonio and Ruiz-Rube, Iv\'{a}n and Mota, Jos\'{e} Miguel and Dodero, Juan M. and Palomo-Duarte, Manuel",10.1145/3012430.3012644,https://doi.org/10.1145/3012430.3012644,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"Learning experiences based on multimodal interactive applications are becoming common at all educational levels. Designing assessments for learning applications is often addressed through learning analytics. Multimodal interactive applications generate a large amount of data about students' interaction that can provide insights about their profile, behavior and performance. Unfortunately, this information is usually not accessible or difficult to collect from such applications, especially for teachers without computer programming skills. In this work, we present a visual development environment that supports the creation of multimodal interactive applications for learning with non-intrusive monitoring capacities, thus providing teachers the opportunity to create their own learning analytics tools even if they are not skilled in computer programming."

Thus, the Polytechnic University of Cartagena has created the Center of Production of Digital Contents with the objective of facilitating the task of creating contents for teachers. With this in mind, this center has developed the UPCTforma environment which includes an authoring tool for creating educational multimedia content, along with evaluation, gamification, authentication and tracking components. In this paper we will present the tracking component responsible for the collection of student tracking data throughout a course. The component also supports data visualization and exporting, to facilitate course monitoring and analysis. UPCTforma uses LTI to enable the developed contents to be integrated into different e-learning platforms. In the case of the tracking component, using LTI permits the registering of student learning tracking independent from the tracking service of the platforms on which the courses are deployed. This is one of the main innovations in the tracking approach presented in this study, which demonstrates the benefits of using LTI."

The research provides evidence both on the use of the technological tool and the instructive task performed with it. Based on a survey of 112 professors, the tools were classified into items of mobile and social media (SM), learning management systems (LMS) and graphic and dynamic visualizations (Graphic). Regarding the Faculty, the study collected a number of sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, discipline, academic background and experience in online teaching. Results show the limited use of technology in classroom, highlighting only those technologies related with graphic and dynamic presentations, while they do show correlation between the use of LMS tools and SM tools. However, significant differences in the use of technology in the classroom have been found between teachers from different disciplines, academic backgrounds and prior experience with online teaching, while no differences were detected in other variables. This investigation thus contributes to studies that aim to advance the effective integration of technology in teaching and learning by introducing relevant teacher variables."

Nevertheless, the increasingly connected world and the unstoppable use of new devices connected to the Internet have really changed the requirements and abilities needed by new generations. Digital competences are the set of new abilities that the international community is integrating into compulsory education and lifelong learning programs to deal with this pressing concern. Boosting these digital skills should be a priority in every government's agenda, not only through lifelong learning programs, but also by including them in compulsory education.This essay presents some of the results from a broader research project on the digital competences of primary school teachers and students in Castile and Leon (Spain). The main goal of the study is to evaluate digital competence levels drawing on an earlier study on the specific international assessment of digital literacy and digital skills. The sample consists of 678 students, ranging in age from seven to twelve years, from public and private schools in urban and rural contexts, and 67 primary school teachers. The comprehensive statistical analysis of the results reflects that both teachers and students lack digital skills. This means that teachers cannot make pedagogical use of them, so that teacher-training policies in this field should be reconsidered. In students it reflects the danger of a digital gap that would not be brought about for reasons of use or access, but from lack of training."

This state of affairs has influenced media not only in the convergence they have suffered but in the way people consume them. The impact of Internet on reception habits and on audiovisual consumption has imposed new patterns of production, marketing and distribution of contents adjusted to the new devices. Although radio is the medium that mostly converges with Internet, the Spanish industry has still not endorsed applications that give a unified access to its complete offer.This article presents an innovative project that strives to develop a new web app: iRadioPlay. The iRadioPlay project, developed by the University Club of Innovation of the Pontifical University of Salamanca (UPSA), proposes a model susceptible to standardization. The project is focused on two main scopes: the first one contributing to increase the radio audience with mobile devices and, the second one to improve the user's experience with the help of complementary information. This application will provide an informative guide with the contents and programmes that can be listened at every moment. The result is a very useful app that covers a lack in the Spanish Radio consumption which is been consider by the radio industry for its digital consolidation."

In this paper we present a multi-user mobile learning system---specifically designed for this study. The system delivers an app version of a paper-based collaborative learning task successfully used for several years with undergraduate students in an A1-level German language course (CEFR). The collaborative learning task, called Terminkalender, requires students to work together to plan different activities and record them in an appointment calendar. While the paper-based version of the Terminkalender already had a great potential for engaging students to communicate and negotiate in the target language, the app-based mobile learning system facilitates students' language learning process---while at the same time allowing teachers to easily trace back learners' interaction in the target language. To this end, specific software implementing several features was developed: a user-friendly web portal interface for teachers, computer-generated anonymous learner identities, an in-app text chat function, real-time task performance feedback to learners as well as a log function for storage and assessment purposes. The experiment provides us with some interesting insights into language learner behaviour and interaction patterns, allowing to draw a number of preliminary conclusions regarding how task design and using a collaborative mobile learning system impacts both student interaction and task performance."

By allowing virtual immersion in a body structure such as the interior of the cranium, stereoscopic vision goggles make these innovative teaching technologies a powerful tool for training in all areas of health sciences, in particular in the sphere of medicine. This work shows the teaching potential of applying Virtual Reality in studies of the human anatomy, where it can be used as a tool for education in medicine. The system we present, developed by the company AR Soft and the research group VisualMed Systems, allows us to enter the cranium through virtual immersion, anatomically analysing each of its component bone structures and visualising the cranium from both inside and out. Exhaustive morphological knowledge of cranial fossae is hugely important, given the increasing use of microsurgery techniques which require suitable knowledge of the detailed morphology of this anatomical structure. Our technological procedure is based entirely on software which will run in stereoscopic goggles to give users the sensation of being in a virtual environment, clearly showing the different bones and foramina which make up the cranium, and accompanied by audio explanations. This procedure allows users to carry out self-assessment, meaning it is also an outstanding training tool."

However, their active participation in society is not reflected sufficiently in policy and decision-making, especially in relation to digital issues. Because of this, they are not well represented and unheard, and this makes it hard for research and policy to identify and understand their needs. These issues are further complicated by the fact that the group is a swiftly moving target, it is as heterogeneous as the wider society, and young people can be unwilling to be subjects of research. The WYRED project (netWorked Youth Research for Empowerment in the Digital society) aims to provide a framework for research in which children and young people can express and explore their perspectives and interests in relation to digital society, but also a platform from which they can communicate their perspectives to other stakeholders effectively through innovative engagement processes. It will do this by implementing a generative research cycle involving networking, dialogue, participatory research and interpretation phases centered around and driven by children and young people, out of which a diverse range of outputs, critical perspectives and other insights will emerge to inform policy and decision-making in relation to children and young people's needs in relation to digital society."

These new competences have become necessary life-long learning competences not only for students from all levels [16] but for all citizens. In the European framework, digital competence was firstly acknowledged in 2006 by the European Union as one of the key competences for life-long learning. However it was in 2013 that the concept was really developed, with a more through understanding provided by the DigComp Project launched by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS), under the supervision of the Education and Culture DG.This article aims to present two scopes of understanding: firstly, to provide a complete overview of digital competence in Europe, presenting a study of the DigComp (2011-2013) Project and the latest version of the project, DigComp 2.0 (2016) which emphasizes the digital environment; and, secondly, to disclose the main differences, mainly promoted by digital changes in society.

Learning lifelong and adult education are strategies that aim to achieve social, cultural and economic development [4]. They are, undoubtedly, strategies that have a positive impact on society. Intergenerational learning is a practice that allows us to include not only the older, as far as the younger population, benefiting from this strategy two disparate generations. Learning throughout life, through intergenerational sociability, has added value, encourages the closeness between the generations: the younger ones, develop a positive image and value the knowledge and skills of the older generations contradicting the myths rooted in society related to aging. At the same time, they acquire scholarship and life experiences from older people, which contributes to the general education of younger people. However, also the elderly benefit from these strategies because they also feel the positive impact of intergenerational learning: well-being and independence, improved self-esteem, with confidence in the future and sense of usefulness and value."
2016,From computational thinking to coding and back,"DePryck, Koen",10.1145/3012430.3012492,https://doi.org/10.1145/3012430.3012492,Association for Computing Machinery,Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,,"Introducing coding in the curriculum at an early age is considered a long term investment in bridging the skills gap between the technology demands of the labour market and the availability of people to fill them. The keys to success include moving from mere literacy to active control - not only at the level of learners but also at the level of teachers. However, given the fast development of the field, one might wonder whether acquiring specific coding skills really is the essence of introducing coding early in the curriculum. We argue that the reach of ICT -including coding skills- is much broader than STEM alone and a background in STEM is no longer a requirement for successful coding. The complex link between coding and computational thinking is the real critical success factor. We refer to TACCLE3 (an EU Erasmus+ project) as a successful approach to the implementation and valorisation of computational thinking across the curriculum."

Body composition and training pre-race experience analyses were conducted previous to a mountain marathon in 52 male athletes (38.3±10.1 years, 173.9±6.5 cm, 72.7±9.9 kg). A significant correlation of race time in the mountain marathon with age (r=.502; p=.002), fat mass (r=.632; p=.000), percentage of body fat (BF, r=.754; p=.000), level of abdominal obesity (r=.482; p=.005), sport experience (r=.467; p=.007) and daily training volume (r=-.527; p=.002) was shown. In mountain marathon body fat and athlete's age were negatively associated with race performance; by contrary, the volume of daily training was positively associated with mountain marathon performance. A regression analysis showed that race time could be predicted (R2 = 0.948) by daily training load, sports experience, age, fat mass, body fat and level of abdominal obesity. The comparison between performance groups with regards to body composition and training characteristics revealed that the higher performance group was lighter with lower body fat, fat mass and level of abdominal obesity, and with more days of training per week than the lower performance group (p&lt;.05). Therefore, coaches and fitness trainers working with mountain marathon runners should (a) develop exercise and nutritional strategies to reduce body fat, and (b) consider increasing daily training volume as a mean to improve sport performance."

These multidimensional textual specifications are particularly relevant in cases of information systems conceived to support processes in narrative-based domains, such as humanities or social sciences. Working on these domains, a hard effort of dimension decoupling and a fully understanding of the domain is required. Thus, software analysts put a considerable effort in the identification of the most relevant concepts of the domain---to create the static structure of the system---and, in a separate manner, in the identification of the activities---to understand how this information is produced and managed by users in real practice---. This paper presents how existing studies aim to bridge this modelling gap between static and dynamic aspects in information systems from a comprehensive perspective. It also proposes a pipeline method to deal with this gap, using a semi-automatic analysis of textual sources. The pipeline focused on the identification of activities and static concepts, producing concept maps as static models and activity logs as dynamic models. The final goal of the proposed pipeline is reducing the domain understanding complexity required to software analysts in humanities information system conception and improving the quality of the models in both static and dynamic dimensions."

The purpose is ensuring the correct use of the IT, generating business value. The main objective is converting the IT in an corporate strategic element, so that it can serve as a support for the corporate managers, allowing them execute actions and optimal decisions, targeted to the effective use of the IT. The IT department objectives must be aligned with the institutional objectives of universities. Some important contributions in this context as well as in the IT Governance in other countries have been detected, so that they will be served as a starting point for the development of a specific framework of IT Governance for the university reality of Ecuador. Initial data are collected trough some instruments, allowing the observation of the achievement of the IT Governance process, using a generic framework as reference and applying the model to a public university of Ecuador. The results will justify and validate the contribution of this research. It is finally concluded that, the ITs not only serve to automate the processes in the organizations, but they must also get involved in the core business and strategy. The adaptation of this model to the public universities of Ecuador will generate a change and will improve decision making in the executive level. This specific framework of IT Governance for universities will be a benchmark of first line for higher education institutions worldwide. The truly integration of ITs in the universities trough a framework of corporate governance will be the strategic road to ""Digital University"" in the future. Otherwise, the universities that do not integrate the ITs in their core will be sentenced to live in the past and to die in a short time."

This study explores how immersive embodied VR biography enhances intercultural empathy and understanding of displaced cultural objects. We took the famous Chinese painting, the Admonitions Scroll, housed at the British Museum as an example to design an Immersive Biography in VR. We conducted an empirical study with 24 participants from source and non-source communities. Findings suggested that interacting with biographical narratives of displaced cultural objects in a personified embodied way can effectively promote intercultural empathy and understanding. Additionally, simulated intercultural scenarios and dialogues with personified cultural objects fostered intercultural empathy in both groups, with a stronger effect observed in non-source communities due to differences in cultural identity and personal connections. Our study provided the potential and practical insights of immersive technologies to inspire intercultural communication for displaced cultural objects."

It is a must in education. Whenever we hear about the use of information technologies in education, the term learning analytics is mentioned. However, learning usually comes more as an afterthought than a core part of educational processes involving the use of IT. Think about how many times have you heard the sentence ""... and, of course, we provide learning analytics with it"" in the past couple of years. Right?Yet, despite the increasing amount of theoretical and applied research on learning analytics, there are still needs that are practically left unattended in most recent research. For example, the role of learning analytics in the current paradigm of student-centred and competence-based learning, information about successful learning analytics-based interventions, cross-validation of prior research, standards for learning analytics, or learning analytics and instructional design. In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies in educational contexts (e.g. smartphones, virtual and augmented reality, social networks), and the ever changing nature of existing ones, bring new challenges and opportunities for research and practice in learning analytics."

Most of them are focused on the development of key competences and/or coding skills. Although coding may be very attractive for young students and a very good practice or experience, it could be more interesting to develop students' logical thinking skills and problem-solving skills throughout programming approaches or computational thinking. This is a very exciting challenge with lots of possibilities regarding coding, robots, mobiles devices, Arduino-based application, game-based learning and so on. Thus it is very important discuss the experiences that are being developed worldwide in specialized for a with researchers that are working on this field, such as for example European Union TACCLE 3 - Coding project.

However, the commercial effects and impact of this technology lacks sufficient research. It is hence uncertain which role virtual reality has in information systems nowadays. This systematic literature review (SLR) focuses on the commercial impact of virtual reality and which field of study this technology is most used. To answer this question, a reference manual was used from literature review protocol standards and carried out. Results show that VR systems have a wide specter of applications and a significant potential for revolutionizing our everyday life in the digital world."

For this to occur three designing stages are needed 1: choosing the object to be studied, 2: searching for evidence in the literature, 3: write the innovative teaching project and two implementation stages: 4: enactment and evaluation, 5: Dissemination which are advised to be accomplished. The completion of those phases may serve to produce Open Educational Resources (OER), which at last, are seen as one of the products of educational innovation. The purpose of this paper is to show what object of study the participant in-service teachers selected for their innovation projects (phase 1) and how they produced OER -methodology-(phase 4) accordingly. Data analysis was conducted using a descriptive exploratory methodology. Results indicate that inservice teachers mainly chose projects in the disciplines of language and mathematics within primary and secondary education levels. On the other hand, Problem based learning (teaching strategy), b-learning (teaching modality) and IDB (teaching resource) were the most used methodologies for OER production. This leads us to understand that language teachers are more prone to design innovative projects in their classrooms. Additionally, they are mostly worried to implement innovative strategies in the OER they produced, rather than teaching modalities or ICT resources."

Within the classroom group of students, a subgroup of students having mathematical difficulties was detected and established as an experimental group, remaining the rest of the students as a control group. An active and participatory work methodology based on paper-and-pencil exercises was carried out with this experimental group. Under the professor's guidance and supervision, but essentially being themselves the main actors, these students should work in extra classroom sessions using exams and reports from previous years, confronting the mathematical difficulties in a progressive way until reaching their full understanding. The results of the experience show an important increase of the students' assistance to examinations, an improvement of qualifications, and an important and statistically significant decrease of questions which stayed unanswered compared with the control group. Overall, both students and the teacher consider that these participatory classes constitute a useful strategy to encourage students' confidence in their capabilities, and to address the subject with a better chance of success. The quantitative data presented validate these claims."

Nevertheless, courses in DH are still usually hosted by English, History or Social Sciences departments, with little or no room for courses offered by Foreign/Modern Language departments. In addition, both undergraduate and graduate humanities students may not feel attracted by courses that focus on digital technologies. In order to overcome these challenges, the Department of Modern and Classical Languages at George Mason University (Virginia, U.S.) is currently carrying out an innovative, participatory curriculum development project involving undergraduate students as consultants and co-producers of course content. This paper describes the theoretical framework for the project and its current stage of development. Advantages and limitations of student engagement in curriculum design are also addressed."

In order to reach very diverse groups of people, educational robots need to be simple, scalable and low cost.Inspired by the success of the LOGO project, we have developed the Phogo pedagogical platform, built around a low cost robot (less than $80) capable of tracing its path with a marker pen. We also present a high-level Python-based control library that allows for transparent and easy wireless communication with the robots. The approach was tested in an informal workshop with a group of teenagers without any previous self-conscious computational knowledge. As the students were attracted by the robot and the simple approach, they were able to gain some insight about abstract programming concepts such as variables, functions, and flow control structures. The majority of the students were people with physical, cognitive or intellectual disabilities and they were able to follow, enjoy and learn as any other student making this an accessible activity to everyone.Finally, we summarize our efforts documenting and publishing the Phogo system as open-source in order to promote its use in future workshops."

The notorious complexity involved in defining the concept of disability, which is even more pronounced in the case of intellectual disability, is interrelated with changes in social and employment practices in social organisations aimed at meeting the needs of people with that condition. There is now broad acceptance that people with intellectual disabilities have full rights as citizens and their quality of life is viewed as the focal point in internal plans and arrangements made by organisations that support them in that. However, this gives rise to the problem of establishing a competency-based organisational framework aligned with the organisation's mission and the achievement of personal goals related to improving their quality of life, as well as implementing means to allow them to be applied operationally and efficiently."
