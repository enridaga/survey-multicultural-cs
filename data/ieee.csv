Human expression is incredibly important in determining a person’s current condition and mood. AI is utilized to analyze human facial expressions and extract emotions based on features such as cheeks, forehead, eyes, and smiles. In addition, “songs” refers to an expressive medium that has always been the best option for analyzing and comprehending human emotions. The proposed ’smart music player' is a programmed system that functions under the assumption that we can tell someone’s mood by the expression on his/her face. This model that recognizes facial micro-expressions with multicultural facial expression details, recommends music in accordance with corresponding mood. It is developed using a combination of song’s features and micro-expression recognition technology of convolutional neural network. To do this, group facial expressions into seven distinct emotional groups, including happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprise and disgust. The primary objective of this study paper is to present an overview of a useful music player and social companion that automatically creates a playlist that will brighten your day based on your emotional condition, along with recommendations for future studies in the field of recommendation systems."

We are particularly interested in competencies that students could and, we believe, should acquire during collaborative learning experiences in project-based IT courses. In the times of globalization and technological advancement, there is a need for competencies like collaborating, communicating, working in interdisciplinary and multicultural teams, while computing education tends to focus on content knowledge and technical skills. Which is contrary to the emphasis companies put on soft skills in a hiring situation. This discussion and reflection paper discuss how employability, and identity frameworks can be used to analyse professional competencies in a project course environment in Norway? This paper focuses on how professional competencies should be implemented in the curriculum of computing degree programs and courses in the Norwegian university system. We use Curtin's graduate attributes"" framework used by an Australian university as an example of learning outcomes that emphasize professional competencies. In this conceptual paper we discuss how putting more emphasis on graduate attributes, employability and identity can help to legitimize diverse ways of participation in the computing discipline and at the same time broaden the identity of the computing discipline."

Academia, however, offers limited opportunities to motivate women to return. We propose a diverse multicultural research project investigating the challenges faced by women with software engineering (SE) backgrounds re-entering academia or related research roles after a career break. Career disruptions due to pregnancy, immigration status, or lack of flexible work options can significantly impact women's career progress, creating barriers for returning as lecturers, professors, or senior researchers. Although many companies promote gender diversity policies, such measures are less prominent and often under-recognized within academic institutions. Our goal is to explore the specific challenges women encounter when re-entering academic roles compared to industry roles; to understand the institutional perspective, including a comparative analysis of existing policies and opportunities in different countries for women to return to the field; and finally, to provide recommendations that support transparent hiring practices. The research project will be carried out in multiple universities and in multiple countries to capture the diverse challenges and policies that vary by location."

It can be delivered in both formal and non-formal institutions, with the goal of instilling humanistic values. In the 21st century, education is closely linked to research, promoting community participation and addressing specific problems through educational projects. This approach includes science, technology, and society (STS), understood as integral elements for value-based education and civic engagement. Currently, education is undergoing a significant transformation, adapting to technological and scientific challenges to improve educational quality. It is essential that educational systems promote skills such as critical thinking and the ability to adapt to a changing economy. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are crucial, enabling meaningful and autonomous learning. Furthermore, family involvement is crucial in the educational process, as parental support improves students' performance and school adaptation. 21st-century educators must be dynamic and flexible, fostering collaborative and empathetic learning in a multicultural environment. The current educational reality, especially in Latin America, presents challenges such as unequal access and the need to train students with relevant skills for social integration. The challenges include the implementation of competencies and the promotion of learning that responds to the demands of the knowledge society. In summary, modern education requires constant innovation, integrating technology and new methodologies to prepare students for a constantly changing future. Teachers and students must adapt to these changes, being proactive in their training and in the application of didactic strategies that foster meaningful and relevant learning."

The European Union (EU) is committed to the 2030 Agenda and the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which the UN itself has recognized cannot be achieved without a people-focused, science-based, digital revolution [2]. This commitment to the 2030 Agenda should entail promoting an inclusive and sustainable AI strategy, rather than a strategy with a narrow focus on competitiveness [3], [4]. In order for AI to contribute to achieving the SDGs, a systemic approach to the development of AI solutions is required [5]-[9]. Conversely, the SDGs provide an ideal framework to test the desirability of AI solutions [10]. Europe's multicultural character and its framework of international collaboration give it a head start toward becoming a global reference in the promotion of an inclusive and sustainable AI. Sharing the experiences and practices of such a European AI could make a significant contribution to achieving the SDGs."
2022,Principle-Based Approach for the De-Identification of Code-Mixed Electronic Health Records,"Wang, Chen-Kai and Wang, Feng-Duo and Lee, You-Qian and Chen, Pei-Tsz and Wang, Bo-Hong and Su, Chu-Hsien and Kuo, Joseph Chin-Chi and Wu, Chi-Shin and Chien, Yi-Ling and Dai, Hong-Jie and Tseng, Vincent S. and Hsu, Wen-Lian",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3148396,,,,,"Code-mixing is a phenomenon where at least two languages are combined in a hybrid manner in the context of a single conversation. The use of mixed language is widespread in multilingual and multicultural countries and poses significant challenges for the development of automated language processing tools. In Taiwan’s electronic health record (EHR) systems, unstructured EHR texts are usually represented in a mixture of English and Chinese which increases the difficulty for de-identification and synthetization of protected health information (PHI). We explored this problem by applying several state-of-the-art pre-trained mono- and multilingual language models and propose to exploit the principle-based approach (PBA) for the tasks of PHI recognition and resynthesis on a code-mixed EHR corpus annotated with 6 main categories and 25 subcategories of PHIs. A hierarchical principle slot schema is defined in the PBA to encode knowledge of code-mixed PHIs and utilize slots to learn from the training set to assemble principles for recognizing PHI mentions and synthesizing surrogates simultaneously. In addition, a semantic disambiguation process is implemented to disambiguate ambiguous PHI categories in the de-identification process and to dynamically extend the knowledge encoded in PBA during the knowledge augmentation process. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the best micro- and macro-F-scores in comparison to the other mono- and multilingual language models fine-tuned on our code-mixed corpus."

2019,Writing in Transnational Workplaces: Teaching Strategies for Multilingual Engineers,"Hodges, Amy and Seawright, Leslie",10.1109/TPC.2019.2930178,,,,,"Introduction: Professional communication instructors in transnational contexts face unique challenges when helping students transition into the workplace. These challenges include preparing students for multilingual workplaces and educational settings, as well as multicultural communication in English at transnational workplaces. About the case: The authors, working at an international branch campus (IBC) in the Middle East, wanted to revise their assignments in a technical writing course for engineers in order to better prepare students for the realities of professional communication in the region. Situating the case: Engineering students matriculate into an increasingly diverse workplace, but instructors may not adequately understand the needs of employers in transnational corporations. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with students and alumni of the IBC, and transcripts were coded for common themes. Results/discussion: Students and alumni had different perceptions of workplace communication genres, expectations for detailed writing, and the ability to adapt rhetorical strategies for different contexts. Alumni experienced a gap between their professors' and their workplaces' expectations for business genres and level of detail. They also reported that one of their significant challenges was adopting a flexible mindset toward written and spoken communication practices. Conclusions: Professional communication instructors should emphasize the strengths of multilingual writers, particularly their sense of language difference and rhetorical attunement, to better prepare them for the transnational workplace, in both the US and abroad. The authors describe changes in their pedagogy to help students adopt a more flexible and industry-oriented mindset toward technical communication."

C.",10.1109/CHASE58964.2023.00026,,,2023 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE),,"Modern society is diverse, multicultural, and multifaceted. Because of these characteristics, we are currently observing an increase in the debates about equity, diversity, and inclusion in different areas, especially because several groups of individuals are underrepresented in many environments. In computer science and software engineering, it seems counterintuitive that these areas, which are responsible for creating technological solutions and systems for billions of users around the world, do not reflect the diversity of the society to which it serves. In trying to solve this diversity crisis in the software industry, researchers started to investigate strategies that can be applied to increase diversity and improve inclusion in academia and the software industry. However, the lack of diversity in computer science and related courses, including software engineering, is still a problem, in particular when some specific groups are considered. LGBTQIA+ students, for instance, face several challenges to fit into technology courses, even though most students in universities right now belong to Generation Z, which is described as open-minded to aspects of gender and sexuality. In this study, we aimed to discuss the state-of-art of publications about the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ students in computer science education. Using a mapping study, we identified eight studies published in the past six years that focused on this public. We present strategies developed to adapt curricula and lectures to be more inclusive to LGBTQIA+ students and discuss challenges and opportunities for future research."

Then, for comparison's sake, the single graduate attribute/criterion of communication and its explanations are analyzed and discussed for the purpose of clarifying differences and areas of confusion to allow international and national accreditation bodies to better formulate agreements on criteria related to communication and language. Results indicate that two of the main international accreditation bodies, the International Engineering Alliance accords and the EUR-ACE Framework Standards have similar communication criteria; however, specifics in regard to international outlook, multicultural understanding, and languages are areas which could be clarified. This could facilitate understanding and cooperation between internationally accredited universities and provide more opportunities for collaboration and improvement of engineering education programs."

Since 2011, the EPS@ISEP programme offers a set of multidisciplinary projects to multicultural teams of students, so that each team element can bring to the project its previous knowledge and background experience. In the spring of 2013, a team choose to develop a pet tracker to provide pet owners with information regarding the whereabouts of their pets and, above all, to reduce the number of pets lost. After analysing related products, the team decided to add extra features for product differentiation. Combining a triple-axis accelerometer, a low cost GPS receiver and the GSM/GPRS communication technology, the team designed a system providing pet location, tracking, map display and activity monitoring services. This paper describes the development process of the Pet Tracker system, comprising a wearable device for pets and a website for pet owners."

At the same time, `internationalisation' is often associated with issues that complicate and pressurise the experiences of `international students' as they attempt to identify and acculturate in their new settings, both socially and educationally, such as blockages in cultural understanding, language barriers and complexities of cross-cultural collaboration. This paper sets out a novel approach to solving these issues for a particular set of students (the large proportion of Chinese studying in Ireland, and specifically in Dublin) by creating original cross-cultural collaborative games (coded by Python) and using gamification based on a new bespoke technology system. This design aims to bridge the gaps in understanding between cultures and to provide an enhanced experience which may even be seen to exceed the levels of engagement of students collaborating in `live' environments. The gamification provides a fun and safe way for Chinese and Irish students to share their culture and language, through unique cross-cultural collaborative games set in a customised bilingually-designed virtual world on a new 3D virtual cloud platform. SMARTlab is developing this unique platform with Hao2 and 3DICC's Terf (an immersive 3D unified collaboration platform integrating game dynamics and adjustable features) and OpenSIM. Our novel collaborative platform further integrates the unique `Virtual World in A Backpack' with a bespoke personalised learning platform in development (Sensei). We show that virtual exposure to Ireland and `Irishness' and the chance to collaborate over time with Irish students can lessen the impact of cultural change and reduce the symptoms of isolation, leading to a more empower and enjoyable learning experience."

An increasing number of Chinese universities provide international engineering education programs for undergraduates majoring in engineering in the form of Lecture-Based Learning models that sometimes separate theory from practice. In this paper, we define the most important competencies of engineers with international competitiveness as being Multicultural, Multidisciplinary, Innovative, Integrative, and skilled in Leadership and develop the International Engineering Practice Program (IEPP) based on Project-Based Learning (PBL) to foster these five competencies. In IEPP, students cooperate in the multidisciplinary research in defining problems, designing, manufacturing, and showcasing the projects. A team composed of one project supervisor, project instructors and assistants are built to guide the students for the practical work and theoretical lectures are offered to them for basic knowledge. Throughout the program, English is used as the working language to develop the student's international outlook. This education model has been evaluated as successful: some students' projects won the top prize in national technological competitions and over 90% of the students consider it effective in both enriching their knowledge base and enhancing their abilities despite slightly more workload."

For many years, undergraduate engineering programs have focused primarily on the classroom experience. To provide more authentic pre-professional preparation, however, undergraduate programs have increasingly encouraged outof-class experiences such as senior design capstone projects, project-based learning, and service learning. While engineering students now graduate with stronger preparation for professional practice, employers still invest significant resources in onboarding programs for early-career engineers. These onboarding programs may include a combination of classroom experiences, technical department rotations, and mentorship. Employers like the Indiana State Department of Transportation, Caterpillar Inc., and General Electric describe their onboarding programs as including technical elements like design, professional skill development such as leadership, and in some cases, mentorship.Although many research studies suggest that project-based learning and service learning programs enhance student preparedness for engineering practice, little is known about how onboarding programs develop the knowledge and skills of early-career engineers, and how these programs build upon the knowledge that they acquired as undergraduates. Preliminary findings suggest that the transitional onboarding programs in engineering practice strengthen competencies such as working on multicultural teams, networking skills, and develop project management skills."

Jason",10.1109/TPC.2018.2857239,,,,,"The author of this book builds a case for designers, marketers, and stakeholders in the global marketplace to incorporate multicultural and international considerations into all aspects of their products and services. The book demonstrates the long-term benefits of internationalization, and it provides useful information about cultural and technological trends across all continents. In addition, the author offers practical advice on aspects of localization that should be brought into research and design. Employing anecdotal observations about a variety of cultures and a small variety of case studies, the author largely succeeds in his endeavor to bring greater consideration for international concerns to the fore of user experience. This book serves as a strong argument for marketers and designers to incorporate internationalization into an organization’s design philosophy so that its products will benefit from the start. However, the book only demonstrates the need for internationalization; it rarely offers suggestions on how to address a large variety of needs at once. Nevertheless, Universal UX Design has merit. Given its emphasis on product design for international markets, the book can serve as supplemental reading for graduate courses in UX design and technical marketing."

Since 2003, the ACE (American Council on Education) has emphasized global competencies, which are defined as ""the attitudes, skills, and knowledge to live and work in a multicultural and interconnected world"". Despite the increasing recognition of the importance of developing these global competencies, opportunities for young people to do so suffer from issues of accessibility. Educational institutions are challenged with providing opportunities to prepare students for global citizenship in the twenty-first century and are working to expand global competency education. Our undergraduate institution is no exception.In accordance with this mission, we incorporated global learning perspectives through a group project in our First-Year-Seminar course to increase students’ interest in global learning experiences (such as studying abroad) and provide resources for students to develop global competencies. This is important both for personal development in the quest for a more equitable world and employability; employers repeatedly convey that awareness of global issues is a highly desirable characteristic in potential hires.In our implementation, students selected a global issue, chosen from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals database, which had unique significance to them and their communities. This approach allowed space for students to take ownership and agency over the content of their learning experiences while ensuring they engaged with the following learning objectives:1)Team collaboration, communication, and cohesion2)Conducting independent research on a global problem and its solutions3)Synthesis of information from multiple sources and perspectives to develop an informed stance4)Developing a stance regarding a global problem and justification of this stance using data5)Creating a well-organized deliverable with consideration for the audience (i.e., their peers) and contextWe point to course survey data and student reflections to evaluate our course. Students conveyed how the course structure enabled them to (a) consider global perspectives around issues that may or may not have been salient to them before the course, (b) experience empathy for people experiencing challenges related to the issues of interest and gratitude for their circumstances, and (c) consider their personal role in addressing global issues in their communities. Students also indicated an interest in further addressing such issues through self-education and advocacy on a community and political scale.To further expand efforts to make global competency education accessible, our next implementation will utilize Collaborative Online International Learning experiences in which students virtually collaborate with students outside of the United States through our local Office of International Affairs. Through these collaborations, students will be challenged to consider how such global issues manifest in different communities, cultures, and geographic regions and the implications of these differences for solution design."
2024,Generative AI-Based Currency Detector for Visually Impaired,"Geetha Rani, E and Guru Sneha, B and Harsha Vardhan, N and Sai Kumar, B and Anusha, D and Vadlamudi, Sandyarani",10.1109/SPARC61891.2024.10828978,,,2024 International Conference on Signal Processing and Advance Research in Computing (SPARC),,"A visually challenged person may find it challenging to distinguish between various denominations of currency. For those who are blind, this process is still challenging even though most of the Indian currency is written in unique characters. Portable solutions for isolation have emerged because of a shortage of available tools. This study details the creation and evaluation of a new assistive technology that uses an easy-to-use currency detection system to improve the financial independence of people with visual impairments. The apparatus employs sophisticated image processing techniques and deep learning algorithms to precisely recognize different banknote denominations. A compact, user-friendly interface that provides audio feedback to convey the denomination to the user ensures ease of use and privacy. A portable computer device connected to a high-resolution camera forms the basis of the system architecture. On this device, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is trained using many datasets of cash photos in various orientations and light conditions. A high recognition accuracy rate is attained by the model, which is essential for real-world uses. Voice commands and tactile buttons work together to make it easy for users to engage with the gadget. Many daily living tasks are made more difficult by the prevalence of visual impairment, particularly those that require the recognition of currency, leaving the affected person dependent on others to complete financial transactions. Its ability to quickly and accurately identify different currencies and output format in audio feedback has proven to be highly beneficial for those with visual impairments who travel or live in multicultural environments. Moreover, positive feedback from user experience evaluations indicates that the system's practical impact extends beyond its technical achievements, with considerable improvements in confidence during financial transactions and ease of use. To ease that dependency, a unique Currency Detector System (CDS) made especially for visually impaired individuals has been created."
2025,Design and Construction of Global Competency Analysis System based on Long Short-Term Memory,"Zhang, Liping",10.1109/ICISCN64258.2025.10934255,,,2025 International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Computational Networks (ICISCN),,"In an era of rapid globalization and increasing workforce mobility, assessing global competency has become a crucial factor for individuals and organizations aiming to thrive in diverse cultural and professional environments. The ability to effectively engage in cross-cultural interactions, demonstrate adaptability in dynamic workplaces, and possess the necessary problem-solving and communication skills is now more important than ever. As businesses expand internationally and educational institutions emphasize global awareness, competency assessment plays a pivotal role in determining the readiness of individuals to function in multicultural settings. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes a Global Competency Analysis System relies on Deep Learning (DL), utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for high-accuracy predictions. The proposed model leverages sequential data processing capabilities of LSTM to analyze multimodal inputs and provide robust competency classification and prediction outcomes. The system is designed to assess global competency through various indicators, including linguistic proficiency, cultural adaptability, problem-solving skills, emotional intelligence, and professional expertise. It processes multimodal data, incorporating text-based responses, behavioral metrics, and historical performance data to generate competency scores. The LSTM-based model is trained on a carefully curated dataset, ensuring diversity and representation to eliminate biases and improve generalizability. Feature extraction techniques are employed to optimize relevant competency indicators, while advanced hyperparameter tuning is implemented to elevate the approach’s efficiency and predictive performance. Extensive experimentation and validation of the proposed framework were conducted using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. The approach attained an exceptional accuracy of 99.4%, depicting its effectiveness in competency evaluation. The impressive precision and recall scores signify the system’s capability to minimize both false positives and false negatives, ensuring reliable assessment results."

To explore the feasible method of Chinese movie’s external diffusion, we take 36 countries along the “Belt and Road” from 2017.12 to 2020.12 as the research object and use the Latent Dirichlet allocation topic model(LDA) to summarize six categories of topics. According to the box office distribution of each topic, all countries are divided into six categories, and we discuss the topic preferences of each country separately. To promote movie diffusion, for regions with significant cultural differences, the movie should be carried out according to their preferred topics; for regions with better development of the movie market but less cooperation, we should output high-quality local movies to carry out cooperation shooting at the same time; for regions with deep cultural exchanges and a weak economy, we should output movies with diverse culture and preaching national spirit. In addition, it is necessary to consider multiple factors such as the political and religious background to avoid breaking group taboos and formulate export plans according to local conditions to achieve multi-ethnic and multicultural integration further."
2025,Impact of Phonological Awareness on Vocabulary Acquisition in Dyslexic Children: Towards an Artificial Intelligence Model for Early Diagnosis,"Biize, Sara and Qbadou, Mohammed and Mansouri, Khalifa",10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016630,,,2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),,"This article examines the influence of phonological awareness on vocabulary acquisition among dyslexic children in a multilingual Moroccan context. The study compares the performance of 20 children, both dyslexic and non-dyslexic, aged 6 to 16 years, assessed using tests for phoneme segmentation, deletion, and blending to measure phonological awareness, as well as receptive and expressive vocabulary tests. The results reveal that dyslexic children score significantly lower in phonological awareness, confirming the presence of phonological deficits within this group. However, correlation and regression analyses indicate weak and non-significant relationships between phonological awareness and vocabulary, contrary to existing literature. This divergence may be attributed to the small sample size, age dispersion, the use of non-adaptive standardized tests, and the complexity of the Moroccan linguistic context. To address these limitations, the development of a supervised classification model using a neural network is proposed. This model, based on local data, could refine diagnostics and identify diverse phonological and lexical profiles, thereby facilitating the development of tailored educational interventions. This study highlights the need for contextualized assessment tools and innovative approaches, integrating artificial intelligence, to better understand and support vocabulary acquisition in dyslexic children within multicultural environments."

However, assessing these competencies in team projects poses challenges, primarily in distinguishing individual contributions, leading to potentially subjective evaluations. Differences in students' skill levels further complicate this process. Despite these difficulties, collaborative work is crucial for building the professional and multicultural skills needed in today's global job market. This research introduces an innovative evaluation strategy to better assess individual contributions within teams. The methodology includes a two-phase individual questionnaire. In the first phase, students outline a solution to a problem in defined steps to ensure comprehensive involvement and understanding. They then correct an intentionally misformulated question, demonstrating their ability to identify and justify corrections. The second phase involves exercises to assess students' grasp of key theoretical concepts applied during their projects. Results showed a more balanced grade distribution and diverse competency development compared to previous semesters. This indicated that not all students develop competencies uniformly, emphasizing the need for tailored teaching and assessment. This study also opens paths for future research on promoting women's participation in STEM, with a focus on equitable development strategies in team settings. (Abstract)"

Scholars have developed Corpus tools to provide linguistic analysis features such as word lists, keywords, collocations, and concordances. In 2003, a lexicographer named Adam Kilgariff developed Sketch Engine, which provides more than 700 text corpora in monolingual and multilingual forms and enables users to create their corpus by crawling the data online or uploading the compiled corpus themselves. In the Indonesian context, Sketch Engine has yet to be used widely, even though this tool provides a promising opportunity in language research. This paper discusses 1) the linguistic features available in Sketch Engine, 2) recent language research articles utilizing Sketch Engine, and 3) possible opportunities and barriers for Indonesia’s research. A conceptual and systematic review of corpus linguistics and Sketch Engine is provided to reach the objectives. The analysis found that Indonesian researchers have not contributed yet to the Indonesian corpus development in Sketch Engine. Possible barriers are as follows: 1) the subscription charge, 2) the unfamiliarity of the tool in corpus linguistic publication in Indonesia, and 3) the lack of understanding and application of corpus linguistics in Indonesian academia. Considering Indonesia as a multicultural country, vast opportunities in micro- and macro-linguistic studies will be beneficial to improve the research quality in the Indonesian context."

The team, rather than the individual, is the basic building block of technology and product development. The use of 'virtual' team is becoming more widespread in a number of disciplines, including software and engineering, as is the topic of leading and managing teams in a cross&#x2010;border, multicultural environment. The leadership of technology and product development projects is a surprisingly multifacetted but potentially very satisfying and rewarding role. Most importantly, the leader is the holder and champion of the high&#x2010;level vision for the new development; he or she is the 'master architect'. The primary means of personal development is through the work itself, not through an endless succession of training courses. The speed of personal development can be accelerated by providing the right opportunities to acquire the skills, supported by guidance and mentoring."

This study compares and contrasts on-demand live translation services with an emphasis on effectiveness and accuracy. It presents a workable approach to smooth multilingual communication, with a focus on Indian languages. A state-of-the-art on-call speech translation system built on a sentence-level Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model is revealed in this work. The NMT approach translates individual sentences, as opposed to previous algorithms that work with full documents, guaranteeing accuracy and context awareness. NMT, BERT, and XL Net are also compared, emphasizing their unique qualities and areas of use. To facilitate easy communication in chosen languages, this model supports Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Urdu, Bengali, and English. This helps address the linguistic variety of India. Its versatility and efficacy are a result of intensive training on a wide range of language pairings, highlighting the contribution of technology to intercultural communication. The study emphasizes how the NMT-based on-call voice translation system improves commu-nication accessibility in our multicultural, globalized society by bridging linguistic gaps, particularly in Indian languages. In addition, a unique application of multithreading has been employed to lower latency by concurrently executing the transcription and translation operations. Research shows that when multithreading is used, the time required for a translation decreases to 93.82 seconds from an initial 137 seconds. This helps to some extent with the latency issue"

These systems must perform well in cultural contexts without annotated affect datasets available for training models. A standard assumption in affective computing is that affect recognition models trained and used within the same culture (intracultural) will perform better than models trained on one culture and used on different cultures (intercultural). We test this assumption and present the first systematic study of intercultural affect recognition models using videos of real-world dyadic interactions from six cultures. We develop an attention-based feature selection approach under temporal causal discovery to identify behavioral cues that can be leveraged in intercultural affect recognition models. Across all six cultures, our findings demonstrate that intercultural affect recognition models were as effective or more effective than intracultural models. We identify and contribute useful behavioral features for intercultural affect recognition; facial features from the visual modality were more useful than the audio modality in this study's context. Our paper presents a proof-of-concept and motivation for the future development of intercultural affect recognition systems, especially those deployed in low-resource situations without annotated data."

Intrigued by this phenomenon, we analyzed the writing of final year technical knowledge as well as competent soft skills. This is awareness increasingly being demanded by professional accreditation bodies. In response, institutions of higher education nowadays have courses or programs that teach students the soft skills part of these requirements, with the hope that by graduation, students can successfully demonstrate that they have met the accreditation standards. Anecdotal evidence from our academic staff, however, have shown that many graduating students have poor writing skills. This is also true for students engineering students, by examining their honors year capstone project reports. By examining the writing competence of these graduating students, the writing mistakes encountered in the reports were collected, analyzed and we propose to develop an online repository, together with the suggested corrections, so that students have online access to additional English writing support. Through this investigation, so-far, we have also uncovered that simple writing mistakes exist in the final version of an academic supervisor approved report. Some perspectives have been offered as to why this may happen."

Since 2016, we have addressed this challenge through a joint design workshop course for 3rd and 4th-year students, aiming to foster cross-cultural understanding and communication skills, thus developing international expertise in design. This course employs a project-based learning (PBL) approach and is a staple in our department's curriculum. It involves mixed groups from our university and international partners working on specific design problems and presenting their solutions. The course, conducted primarily in English, emphasizes non-native linguistic and non-verbal communication through visual expressions like sketches and drawings. One objective is to provide students with the skills necessary for effective cross-cultural communication. Typically, this intensive summer course alternates annually between Japan and partner countries. However, the COVID-19 pandemic 2020 necessitated a shift to an online format to maintain the course's objectives despite travel restrictions. This paper highlights the adaptations made from FY2020 to FY2021 to continue the program online.

This mixed-methods study examines an innovative pedagogical approach integrating socio-technical awareness and stakeholder management into engineering education through problem-based learning. Through a semester-long intervention with 43 participants, we investigated how restructured learning environments prepare engineering students for leadership roles in diverse, global contexts. Quantitative analysis revealed significant improvements in students' ability to identify business implications and stakeholder concerns, with notable gains in intercultural awareness among majority students. Qualitative analysis of student journals and interviews from 38 participants revealed three themes essential for future technical leaders: evolving professional identity, comfort with organizational ambiguity, and cross-cultural stakeholder engagement. Teams with diverse composition demonstrated higher performance in solution viability and business impact assessment, while structured cross-cultural exchanges improved cultural humility across all participants. Students from diverse backgrounds showed superior initial stakeholder awareness compared to their peers, their perspectives enhancing majority students' understanding of global markets and inclusive decision-making. The integration of modern business tools, including AI-aided stakeholder mapping, provided insights into technology management in multicultural contexts. Through careful scaffolding of learning experiences and intentional reflection activities, students developed both technical competence and leadership capabilities simultaneously. The study also revealed important considerations for scaling these approaches, particularly regarding faculty development and institutional support structures. Our findings demonstrate that embedding business principles and intercultural experiences in engineering education through structured reflection better prepares students for executive roles in global organizations. These results contribute to ongoing discussions about engineering education reform while emphasizing the critical need for institutional support in developing the next generation of engineering leaders who can effectively navigate the intersections of technology, business, and diverse societal needs."

How can a city, a complex of such diverse members, achieve a sustainable local community? Currently, there are about 460,000 Koreans living in Japan. The largest number live in Ikuno district, Osaka. After the end of World War II to the present, Koreans in Japan have been subjected to discrimination and hatred in Japanese society, such as national education, fingerprinting refusal movement, and hate speech. By solving these social conflicts and problems, they needed an opportunity to strengthen their sense of fellowship through confirmation of their identities, and to inform the society and region of their presence. At this time, `Matsuri', played a big role in expanding communication with other groups for maintaining their identity. `Matsuri' is a traditional Japanese festival based on the religious purpose and the bond of local residents. In this article, we examine how the festivals in many ethnic groups played a role in reducing the conflict between the Japanese local community and the ethnic group. We will discuss a sustainable society where ethnic groups can live all together, through the analysis of `Ikuno Cultural Festival' and `Ikuno Korea town Festival' held in Osaka."

China, experiencing fast economic development, is confronted with challenge of losing its splendid ethnic minority culture inheriting from thousands of years ago. Though government is calling for attentions and made laws to help protect the minority culture in China and built museums. but the young generation of Chinese people tend to migrate to urban areas for career development, where innovation, technology and efficiencies are more valued than ethnic diversity. This paper builds upon ”Boundless Grassland”, ”The Believer’s Last Word”, ”JunMa, CangLang, GuXiang”, ”Fu Qin Yu You Er Qu”, ”Da Sheng Kui Shang Hao”, providing evidence of culture fading by analyzing the frequency of appearance of Mongolian Culture related images in those novel. The reasons of choosing novels as the data sources are the popularity of the novels is high enough, those novels are all written by Mongolian writers in China, and the the concentrated description or implication about the status quo of Mongolian Culture that are presented along the action of the characters in the novels. Based on Edward W Said’s Orientalism, deep literature analysis methods of content analyses were used to ground change of Mongolian culture from the images presented in the novels that falls into 6 sectors: symbols, language, beliefs, values, and artifacts. I found that first, the fading of Chinese ethnic minority culture starts when modernization starts. Second, internal Orientalism caused culture fade and posed a strong threat to the preservation of Ethnic minority culture. Third, the process of objectification and internal Orientalism and their impact can be generalized to other culture. This work contributes to the literature of Orientalism, where China’s data and state-of-art is rarely documented. Mongolian culture is one of the most influential culture on the world that impacted over half of the world throughout its history. The conservation of Mongolian culture is vital for the ethnic Mongolians, and will serve as a road map for the later preservation of the Culture of Ethnic Minority."

These workers are also more likely to have job security than unskilled and sometimes untrained workers. Competency has become a key concept in human resource management because it helps to identify the factors and pathways that can lead to a high performing, competent workforce. Nowadays, new competencies are being identified, such as a project-oriented approach, innovative behaviour and even an agile mindset. These concepts have not been encountered so far, or at least not to such an extent. The aim of our study is to identify and assess, through the eyes of different generations, which competences lead towards agile behaviour, based on the results of a primary research, highlighting the readiness and preparedness of different age groups to operate in an agile way."

To solve the problems, we have focused on drawing tests for screening and developed a tablet-type drawing data acquisition system to collect drawing data from young children. In this study, we investigate the relationship between developmental age and features extracted from stroke data in drawing. Specifically, based on the pen tip's position with each elapsed time from the test's start, we extracted each drawn figure's features, such as speed during drawing, for performing a multiple regression analysis using these features and living age in months as an explanatory variable and developmental age in months as the objective variable. As a result, we found that living age in months contributed the most to estimating developmental age in months."

This study compared the behavioral characteristics, perspectives, and emotional expressions of players in Souls-like games from different cultural backgrounds, specifically examining the distinctions and commonalities among them. Natural language processing techniques were employed to analyze English, Chinese, and Russian reviews of 17 Souls-like games to investigate players' gaming experiences, including gameplay behaviors, game evaluations, and emotional experiences. The findings revealed significant disparities among players from different cultures in all three aspects of their engagement with Souls-like games. Specifically, these players exhibited significant culture-related variations in their behavioral characteristics toward Souls-like games. In terms of perspectives, English-speaking players tended to focus more on game optimization, whereas Chinese and Russian players paid greater attention to game combat design. Regarding emotional expressions, Chinese players were more prone to exhibit emotions of anger and disgust, while English and Russian players displayed a more neutral emotional stance. These cultural insights provide valuable information for game developers to better meet the needs and expectations of players from different cultural backgrounds. This study not only broadens our understanding of player behaviors and cultural influences but also lends robust support to cross-cultural gaming research."

Background: EPS is a one-semester capstone project framework that adopts project-based learning and multicultural, multidisciplinary teamwork. Educating engineers for sustainable development requires fostering critical and ethical thinking and a desire for equity, solidarity and preservation of natural resources, and cultural and genetic diversity. Existing engineering capstone design programs emphasize solving real world problems, hands-on training, and soft skills, but few focus on sustainability aspects of engineering design. The three Iberian EPS providers adopt project-based learning and teamwork methodologies, promoting the development of transversal skills and addressing sustainability in a multicultural and multidisciplinary background. Intended Outcomes: To show that the three Iberian EPS providers follow these recommendations and contribute to raising students’ awareness of sustainable development. Application Design: The proposed sustainability learning assessment method collects evidence from syllabi, project briefs, report templates, and final reports to extract faculty and student perspectives. The sustainability-related terms collected were processed into word cloud format, allowing a simple and intuitive interpretation of students’ understanding of sustainability, and in co-occurrence network format, to understand if sustainability has a pervasive or confined presence within the reports. Findings: Iberian EPS faculty and students are aware of the social, economic, and environmental impact of their projects, in terms of quality of life, social responsibility, the use of resources, and environmentally friendly technology."

2022,An award winning approach to education relating to renewable energies,"Gilmour, Bob",10.1109/EFEA56675.2022.10063830,,,2022 7th International Conference on Environment Friendly Energies and Applications (EFEA),,"The growth in employment for the renewables industry combined with transition from other energy sources, is predicted to result in over 100 million employees in the sector worldwide by 2030 [1]. These employees will come from a variety of disciplines, cultures and backgrounds and will require a range of education and training to help us address climate change. Higher Education Institutions (HEI) will be a primary provider of this education/training and whilst there is an increasing number of renewable energy courses being developed, many of them focus on one discipline. They therefore potentially miss the benefits of multidisciplinary and intercultural group learning to help develop the “durable skills” required by industry [2]. This paper charts the on-going journey of an award-winning approach to learning [3] associated with the renewables sector that has been developed in Universities and industry in Europe. The Promoting Excellence in Employability and Transversal Skills (PEETS) initiative co-created a variety of innovative learning opportunities for students and staff enhancing both knowledge and skills development. Experiential and problem-based challenges through eg the construction of 5m tall wind turbines at a 10 day intensive study period, supported deeper learning through reflection. This initiative was awarded the prestigious Collaborative Award for Teaching Excellence (CATE) by AdvanceHE in 2019. Such a model of interdisciplinary learning is readily transferable across the sector and can assist in the development and application of environment-friendly energies."
2021,Diversity and Communication in Virtual Project Teams,"Varhelahti, Mervi and Turnquist, Tiia",10.1109/TPC.2021.3064404,,,,,"Introduction: Virtual teams, especially project teams, increasingly rely on computer-mediated communication for interaction when collaborating and completing their tasks. Team members represent various cultures, occupations, and industries. Virtual teams often use English as a business lingua franca in communication. This study investigates critical factors related to virtual project teams that influence computer-mediated communication. Research questions: 1. How is diversity in video meetings experienced by the members of multidisciplinary and multicultural project teams? 2. Do differences in team members’ occupational or industrial backgrounds show in their opinions on video meetings? Literature review: The effectiveness of communication has been identified as playing a critical role in the success of virtual projects. Diversity, whether disciplinary or cultural, enriches teamwork by bringing different viewpoints to discussions. On the other hand, diversity can also set some challenges for communicating these viewpoints. Research methodology: Mixed methods were used to analyze data obtained from 104 responses to an online survey. Spearman's correlation coefficient and Kruskall-Wallis nonparametric tests were used for statistical analysis, and open comments were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results and conclusion: The findings show that linguistic, cultural, and occupational diversity facilitates communication in virtual project team meetings. In addition, applying appropriate features of video meeting tools in different stages of project teamwork leads to better communication in virtual teams. A high level of English proficiency is not required, but clear communication rules are essential. In addition, some occupational or industry-specific differences in opinions on communication could be identified."

From two recent multi-language, multi-cultural pan-African online surveys to assess the impact on students, over 6,000 responses showed the twin constraints of irregular electric power supply and poor internet connectivity to effectively participate in virtual learning. This project is aimed at developing an affordable and reliable power and communication device for continuous online learning for engineering students, showcasing the strength in Africa's diversity through a collaborative, multinational, multicultural, multi-lingual and gender-sensitive platform to solve this identified global African Engineering Education challenge. A collapsible 100-watt solar photovoltaic module charging a set of lithium batteries via the charge controller was used to power a laptop computer, a mobile phone and a 5-watts bulb simultaneously through a Direct Current/Direct Current (DC/DC) converter. An embedded modem in the device provided the wireless network for internet connectivity. The initial prototypes produced weighed less than 7 kg, and preliminary performance tests showed that the gadget was able to charge up a laptop and two smartphones totaling 45.5WH from 0% to 100% while the remaining backpack state of charge remains 12.8V at 88% (that is 12% depth of discharge). The power supply and communication device for continuous online learning for African engineering students will not only bring engineering solution collaboration among hundreds of engineers, technologists, and technicians from the entire African continent, but will also boost entrepreneurial skills for many African engineering practitioners when fully commercialised."
2018,"Linking the Getty Vocabularies: The Content Perspective, Including an Update on CONA","Harpring, Patricia",10.23919/PNC.2018.8579460,,,2018 Pacific Neighborhood Consortium Annual Conference and Joint Meetings (PNC),,"This paper focuses on issues surrounding the rich content of the Getty vocabularies, [1] particularly as they have transitioned from more traditional data releases to become optimized for release as LOD and beyond. The Getty vocabularies have been a mainstay of cataloging, indexing, and access for art, architecture, and other cultural heritage information since the 1980s. They are compiled resources that grow through contributions from the expert user community. They are multicultural and multilingual, currently being translated in several languages. With the release of the AAT (Art & Architecture Thesaurus®), ULAN (Union List of Artist Names®), and TGN (Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names®) as Linked Open Data (LOD), [2] the Getty vocabularies are entering a new world of seemingly limitless possibilities in digital scholarship. With the addition of new resources, CONA (Cultural Objects Name Authority®) and the Getty Iconography Authority (IA), the Getty vocabularies are poised to truly become linchpins in joining disparate resources from diverse disciplines, including art museums, special collections, libraries, archives, conservation, archaeology, visual resources, universities, and other researchers. The Getty vocabularies may serve as conduits through which data about art, architecture, and other cultural heritage are created and accessed for research and discovery. From their inception, the Getty vocabularies were designed to be linkable to each other and to the broader realm of cultural heritage information. For example, in the AAT, concepts are linked to each other through hierarchical and associative relationships with defined relationship types that inform the user that a rhyta (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300198841) is a type of ancient drinking vessel having an animal shape and is distinguished from vessels in other cultures having a similar purpose or appearance, such as stirrup cups and sturzbechers. In ULAN, the record for a person such as Katsushika Hokusai (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ulan/500060426) may include various go names and aliases, and links to records for his teachers, family, and a novelist with whom he collaborated. In TGN, a geographic place record for Siena (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7011179) may include ancient names, as well as links to multiple broader hierarchical contexts, for the modern nation of Italy as well as the ancient confederation of states, Etruria. In the IA, an Aztec character Ometecuhtli (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ia/901002056) may be linked to named legends in which he is a character, as well as to other characters or places to which he is related. In CONA, titles/names and other information for works of art, including architecture, movable works (paintings, sculptures, textiles), and conceptual works (multiples) are linked to AAT, ULAN, TGN, IA and external sources, linking rich information from multiple sources to describe works whether extant, destroyed, or designed but never built. An example is the Old Trikuta temple (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/cona/700002003)."
2025,Artificial Intelligence in Dyslexia Research and Education: A Scoping Review,"Yap, Jia Rong and Aruthanan, Thirishankari and Chin, Mellisa",10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3526189,,,,,"Advancements in artificial intelligence have enabled its integration into research and educational settings, particularly in supporting students with dyslexia. This scoping review explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence in dyslexia research and education, outlining its applications, opportunities, and challenges. A search across Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and ERIC yielded 683 unique articles, of which 84 met the inclusion criteria. The findings reveal four primary applications of AI in dyslexia education and research: early detection and diagnosis, personalised learning and interventions, speech and language processing as well as brain imaging and neuroimaging analysis. Additionally, five significant challenges were identified: data quality and quantity, accessibility of artificial intelligence-powered support, bias and validity in assessments, balancing artificial intelligence assistance with human expertise, and transparency in artificial intelligence decision-making. Actionable steps are recommended to enhance dyslexia research and education to address these challenges. Key approaches include improving artificial intelligence tools for early detection, ensuring inclusivity in affordable systems, addressing ethical concerns, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, training educators and developing culturally relevant tools. Future research should focus on the creation of tools for non-English-speaking and multicultural contexts, advancing research in neuroimaging and personalised learning, longitudinal studies on artificial intelligence interventions, and the establishment of ethical frameworks for the responsible deployment of artificial intelligence in dyslexia education. By navigating these complexities of artificial intelligence integration, we can unlock its full potential to revolutionise dyslexia education and create more inclusive, effective, and ethical learning environments for all."
2021,Economy-Development-Sustainability: Conciliatory Visions towards an Environmentally Ethical Engineering Education,"Gericota, Manuel",10.1109/WEEF/GEDC53299.2021.9657243,,,2021 World Engineering Education Forum/Global Engineering Deans Council (WEEF/GEDC),,"Economy, development, and sustainability are realities that are heavily intertwined. All those realities are the playground of engineers. The world we live in is multicultural and highly unequal. While engineering activities bring benefits, contributing to a more prosperous and equitable world, they may lead to potentially adverse consequences. Because the reality of each society is different from all others, it is not possible to define a one-size-fits-all approach to engineering education regarding ethical practices and sustainable development. It is, therefore, necessary to devise a conciliatory vision towards an environmentally ethical engineering practice that, at the same time, protects the environment while enabling all humans to leave with a minimum of dignity. This paper aims to raise awareness of the challenges facing humanity in the coming years, the role engineers must play in confronting them, and the paths they need to explore to find the right solutions. It is our responsibility to train young engineering students to be up to those challenges."

Consequently, Higher Education institutions constantly review their teaching methods to offer better and more innovative programs in this area. Challengebased learning helps students develop competencies while working on real projects and collaborating with different actors from the industry and academy. This study proposes the development of entrepreneurial competencies of students enrolled in a course designed around an international Challenge-based Learning between two institutions in Spain and Mexico. The experience has been developed through an online learning format with a real challenge delivered by an academic partner who was involved and interacted with students online and face-to-face in the two different locations. The goal for students was to learn, use, and apply data analytics through machine learning and to create an innovative solution around the challenge. Pre- and post-surveys were conducted to analyze the students' perceptions and performance in the learning experience. Results and findings show the students' perception regarding the development of learning through the challenge experience and the engrossment of the training partner regarding entrepreneurship and innovation competencies, multiculturalism, and the use of technologies to resolve the challenge. This work contribution shows the relevance of the Global Challenge-based Learning framework and its impact on collaborating with different disciplines and being open to diversity, especially when developing solutions for real problems. This work highlights the importance of practical teaching methods in entrepreneurship and the relevance of working in multidisciplinary and multicultural environments."
2024,A Comparative Study on the Characteristics and Behaviours of Social Media Users in Response to Fake News on X(Twitter),"Buhari, Murtala Aminu and Mohammadi, Azadeh and Saraee, Mo and Olalekan, Salau Ayodeji",10.1109/NIGERCON62786.2024.10927148,,,2024 IEEE 5th International Conference on Electro-Computing Technologies for Humanity (NIGERCON),,"Social media has proven to be a game- changer in providing avenues for individuals from diverse back- grounds to communicate, exchange ideas, and enable friendships and businesses to reach new heights. Despite these profound advantages, it also has its downsides, especially when exposing users to fake news. The most worrisome aspect is when users react to such information using hate speech. Recent research has shown that fake news generates the most hate speech, as it evokes primordial sentiments of othering, dehumanization, and tribalism in multicultural societies. The study aims to compare the characteristics and behaviours of users engaged with hateful responses and those not engaged in hateful responses in code- mixed Nigerian English (broken) and English over events from 153 fake news posts from the political sphere in the Nigerian Election of 2023. The list of debunked fake stories was gathered from fact-checking websites, and the social media users who propagated these stories were identified. A corpus of 18,000 tweet replies was curated together with user profile information. A subset of 129 random hate speech and control non-hate speech user profiles was selected for this study. The main aim of the study was to investigate the unique characteristics of hate speech respondents and non-hate speech respondents by examining their profile descriptions. Hate users tend to have more followers, and engagement metrics than non- hate users even though they are not as active as non-hate users. Hate speech users had more blue verifications and location details on their profiles, but non- hate speech users’ locations had more identifiable real-world locations. The novel findings provide deeper insights into the characteristics of hate users, which can be used to develop features that will improve moderation and detection by machine learning algorithms."

Andragogy (by Knowles) describes the Art and Science of teaching adults. When teaching, educators have to take the adult as an experienced, self-directed and task oriented individual into consideration and be culturally intelligent. In addition, contemporary education in the technology field requires an approach, which is interactive, task oriented and focused on solving real-life problems. Educators, at RIMC/IMTC, at the U.S. Consulate General Frankfurt, are faced with challenges like, multiculturalism, understanding adult education, and teaching IT concepts to these populations. As a work-related project, the investigator conducted the aforementioned research at RIMC/IMTC located at the U.S. Consulate General, Frankfurt. Current research is concerned with whether Andragogy can be applied to adults from different cultural backgrounds at IMTC Frankfurt. Specifically, the intent of the investigation is to determinewhether cultural factors have an impact on adults learning IT concepts at IMTC Frankfurt."

It is a fact that the so called global work market has become challenging and increasingly multicultural The not so new trend for university programs is the internationalization that is a strategic element to raise the quality of courses and thus attracts more students. This trend has made many universities to revise and update their strategies so that their students and their graduates can have the essential academic and professional skills that allow them to enter and to stay in the work market. Although it is not the only measure that guarantees a good course it adds value for the formation of the new professional. The objective is to make it more attractive and promote the double diploma in order to higher the quality of the offered programs.
2021,Unsupervised Pre-training for Person Re-identification,"Fu, Dengpan and Chen, Dongdong and Bao, Jianmin and Yang, Hao and Yuan, Lu and Zhang, Lei and Li, Houqiang and Chen, Dong",10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01451,,,2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),,"In this paper, we present a large scale unlabeled person re-identification (Re-ID) dataset ""LUPerson"" and make the first attempt of performing unsupervised pre-training for improving the generalization ability of the learned person Re-ID feature representation. This is to address the problem that all existing person Re-ID datasets are all of limited scale due to the costly effort required for data annotation. Previous research tries to leverage models pre-trained on ImageNet to mitigate the shortage of person Re-ID data but suffers from the large domain gap between ImageNet and person Re-ID data. LUPerson is an unlabeled dataset of 4M images of over 200K identities, which is 30× larger than the largest existing Re-ID dataset. It also covers a much diverse range of capturing environments (e.g., camera settings, scenes, etc.). Based on this dataset, we systematically study the key factors for learning Re-ID features from two perspectives: data augmentation and contrastive loss. Unsupervised pre-training performed on this large-scale dataset effectively leads to a generic Re-ID feature that can benefit all existing person Re-ID methods. Using our pre-trained model in some basic frameworks, our methods achieve state-of-the-art results without bells and whistles on four widely used Re-ID datasets: CUHK03, Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17. Our results also show that the performance improvement is more significant on small-scale target datasets or under few-shot setting."

In this context, we identify an interesting question that has previously not received research attention: is it possible to combine two or more 3DMMs that (a) are built using different templates that perhaps only partly overlap, (b) have different representation capabilities and (c) are built from different datasets that may not be publicly-available? In answering this question, we make two contributions. First, we propose two methods for solving this problem: i. use a regressor to complete missing parts of one model using the other, ii. use the Gaussian Process framework to blend covariance matrices from multiple models. Second, as an example application of our approach, we build a new head and face model that combines the variability and facial detail of the LSFM with the full head modelling of the LYHM. The resulting combined model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing head models by a large margin. Finally, as an application experiment, we reconstruct full head representations from single, unconstrained images by utilizing our proposed large-scale model in conjunction with the Face-Warehouse blendshapes for handling expressions."
2022,On the Relationship Between the Developer’s Perceptible Race and Ethnicity and the Evaluation of Contributions in OSS,"Nadri, Reza and Rodríguez-Pérez, Gema and Nagappan, Meiyappan",10.1109/TSE.2021.3073773,,,,,"Context: Open Source Software (OSS) projects are typically the result of collective efforts performed by developers with different backgrounds. Although the quality of developers’ contributions should be the only factor influencing the evaluation of the contributions to OSS projects, recent studies have shown that diversity issues are correlated with the acceptance or rejection of developers’ contributions. Objective: This paper assists this emerging state-of-the-art body on diversity research with the first empirical study that analyzes how developers’ perceptible race and ethnicity relates to the evaluation of the contributions in OSS. We also want to create awareness of the racial and ethnic diversity in OSS projects. Methodology: We performed a large-scale quantitative study of OSS projects in GitHub. We extracted the developers’ perceptible race and ethnicity from their names in GitHub using the Name-Prism tool and applied regression modeling of contributions (i.e, pull requests) data from GHTorrent and GitHub. Results: We observed that (1) among the developers whose perceptible race and ethnicity was captured by the tool, only 16.56 percent were perceptible as Non-White developers; (2) contributions from perceptible White developers have about 6–10 percent higher odds of being accepted when compared to contributions from perceptible Non-White developers; and (3) submitters with perceptible non-white races and ethnicities are more likely to get their pull requests accepted when the integrator is estimated to be from their same race and ethnicity rather than when the integrator is estimated to be White. Conclusion: Our initial analysis shows a low number of Non-White developers participating in OSS. Furthermore, the results from our regression analysis lead us to believe that there may exist differences between the evaluation of the contributions from different perceptible races and ethnicities. Thus, our findings reinforce the need for further studies on racial and ethnic diversity in software engineering to foster healthier OSS communities."

Skipping the morning breakfast, makes the majority of them feel tired and unfocused in the classroom. In addition, eating junk food may result in regression in children performance and generate important diseases like overweight or teeth decay. Several initiatives have been proposed to incite children to take their daily breakfast before going to school. However, we still need more efficient and attractive approaches to motivate the children eat healthily. In this research, we propose a virtual reality immersive system that allows the children to prepare their breakfast through direct interaction with food items. They can move into the virtual environment and select the food they like and receive immediate feedback about them. This approach enhanced the learning skills of children and kept them engaged for a longer time. An animated multimedia based tutorial is presented first to the children within a family setting to teach them about the importance of daily breakfast and the available items. They are then asked to use the virtual reality system to select healthy elements for their breakfast using a handy controller. They can see the items in an immersive environment and hold them virtually and place them on their plates. We compare the proposed VR approach with the traditional approaches of teaching. A group of 29 school children of 7-9 years old have been assessed using the different approaches. Our findings show clearly that the VR approach is a promising approach to learn. The children enjoyed learning through the VR and become more engaged as they interacted directly with the food items in a fully immersive environment."

Using an experimental design, we exposed participants to a fictitious company website promoting an employer brand of diversity. Participants were then randomly shown a fictitious Linked In employee search result page depicting high-or low-employee diversity. Using the instrumental-symbolic framework and warranting theory, we posit that consistent information from Linked In will result in more positive image perceptions of organizations, ultimately leading to higher organizational attraction. Results show that participants who were exposed to information consistent with the organizational website promoting diversity rated that organization higher in agreeableness, and perceived agreeableness fully mediated the relationship between the experimental condition and organizational attractiveness."

A network of 11293 users that used the hashtag #illridewithyou and their tweets were analyzed to examine the nature of engagement at network, ego, and semantic levels. Results show that although the #illridewithyou network has some characteristics of scale free networks, including a high clustering coefficient, low mean geodesic distance, and degree distribution approximating the power law, it lacks a giant connected component, but rather is structured into local clusters. Citizen participation, as indicated by out-degree, was considerably high in the network, and the topics discussed in the Tweets ranged from religion and empathy to globalism, multiculturalism and peace. Participants are globally connected but active in small clusters."

The results show that financial innovation within the research period is not only product-focused and in contrast mainly determined by IT-related innovations like risk management systems, credit scoring models and risk or pricing algorithms. The present empirical analysis furthermore addresses the simultaneous causality between innovation and risk-taking, which causes an endogeneity problem in the regression analysis. Two potential instrumental variables for innovation have been examined, which focus on the open-mindedness of the banks' headquarter environments in terms of racial and ethnic diversity and sexual orientation. The results underline the positive effects of an open-minded environment on the innovativeness of the financial industry. Innovation, synthesized by the instrumental variable Ssex, tends to decrease bank risk-taking."

Further, many of these datasets lack diversity in terms of ethnicity and demographics, which can lead to biased models that can have serious societal and security implications. To address these issues, we propose a methodology that leverages the biased generative model StyleGAN2 to create demographically diverse images of synthetic individuals. The synthetic dataset is created using a novel evolutionary search algorithm that targets specific demographic groups. By training face recognition models with the resulting balanced dataset containing 50,000 identities per race (13.5 million images in total), we can improve their performance and minimize biases that might have been present in a model trained on a real dataset."

Software professionals learned from their experience during the pandemic that most of their work can be done remotely, and now software companies are expected to adopt hybrid work models to avoid the resignation of talented professionals who require more flexibility and work-life balance. However, hybrid work is a spectrum of flexible work arrangements, and currently, there are no well-established hybrid work configurations to be followed in the post-pandemic period. Goal. We investigated how software engineers are experiencing the post-pandemic hybrid work landscape, aiming to understand the factors that influence their choices between remote and in-office work. Method. We explored a large South American company by collecting quantitative and qualitative data from 545 software professionals who are currently navigating diverse hybrid work arrangements tailored to their individual and team requirements. Findings. Our study revealed an array of factors that significantly impact hybrid work within the software industry, including individual preferences, work-life balance, commute time, social interactions, productivity, and more. Team dynamics, project demands, client expectations, and organizational strategies also play an important role in shaping the complex landscape of hybrid work configurations in software engineering. Conclusions. In summary, the success of hybrid work models depends on balancing individual preferences, team dynamics, and organizational strategies. Our study demonstrated that, at present, there is no one-size-fits-all individuals approach to hybrid work in the software industry.

Supervisor's tone of voice in recorded audio feedback,"Heimbürger, Anneli and Isomöttönen, Ville",10.1109/FIE.2017.8190646,,,2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),,"Providing feedback to learners on their writing assignments is one of the most important and time-consuming tasks that a supervisor performs. In e-Education environments, especially in the case of distance learning, giving feedback becomes more challenging because there are often no opportunities for face-to-face interaction. Typically, a supervisor provides comments to learners in written form via email; however, the use of recorded audio feedback (RAF) in e-Education environments has become a viable alternative. This work in progress reports on learners' perceptions of RAF in a multi-cultural higher e-Education context. Our observations indicate that learners tend to have positive feelings toward RAF and that RAF potentially moderates cultural effects. The observations are discussed in light of the relevant literature, and future research questions are proposed."

Connecting several Master programmes in a cross-border virtual Master School is a straightforward approach for high-quality Master education - especially in domains with a high level of transdisciplinary, international cooperation (e.g. the KIC Master Schools [3], or the MSPME [4]). The EuroMPM uses the concept of the cross-border Master School to address some typical competence requirements for international project managers: intercultural teamwork & communication, interdisciplinary & international cooperation, diversity in topics and tailored approaches (driven by innovations, technology development and new business models, e.g. the digital transformation) and project complexity. The EuroMPM Master School goes beyond traditional exchange semesters. Important elements are block-oriented teaching in workshops with students and lecturers from partner universities, with industry involvement [5] and with an interdisciplinary teamwork. Exchange is fostered by a high number of interaction points between the programmes, e.g. summer schools and student conferences. Furthermore, the concept of the international classroom contributes to a unique learning experience. A virtual cross-border Master School on a European scale as the EuroMPM has the required international project culture already in its own DNA. EuroMPM conducts the research on the efficiency and effectivity of the competence delivery based on a tailored indicator framework. We will present the EuroMPM concept, excerpts of the indicator framework and examples of measurement results."

Based on average MIR values, location and physical ability factors were characterized as most critical among the workforce diversity factors affecting the labor productivity. Also, it was identified that the labor productivity is highly reliant on the location of the workplace, the environment provided, the physical ability of a worker, cultural norms and lockdown effects particularly. This research involves the participants from the construction industry of Pakistan; the potential research can be extended to further service sectors and growing economies."
2017,Service quality performance of student housing: The effects on students' behavioural intentions,"Najib, Nurul'Ulyani Mohd and Yusof, Nor'Aini and Tabassi, Amin Akhavan",10.1109/SCORED.2017.8305393,,,2017 IEEE 15th Student Conference on Research and Development (SCOReD),,"In recent years, there has been extensive research on student housing with the most debatable research topic focusing on student's residential satisfaction. However, there is still a dearth of research trying to understand how students perceive the performance of service quality in student housing and how students translate their perceptions into behavioural intentions. Thus, this study has investigated service quality performance as the main factors to influence the students' behavioural intentions. Paper-and-pencil questionnaires were distributed face-to-face to 1526 students in seven Malaysian public and private universities and 1184 useful responses were received. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and covariance-based structural equation modelling. The results revealed that the aesthetic, freedom, serenity, and management dimensions significantly influenced the slightly likely execution of favourable behavioural intentions. The results imply that when students are adaptable to living in a multi-cultural community, have personal privacy, receive good hospitality, and perceive suitable building ambiance, they will show positive behaviour towards their student housing."

A comprehensive cross-domain classification performance assessment reveals disparities in model performance across different cultural contexts, indicating challenges in cross-cultural FER. To further investigate these characteristics, several public datasets across regions and our cross-cultural dataset of facial expressions derived from Thai and Japanese TV shows are analyzed. By evaluating the capacity of existing FER models to interpret our newly collected data, we found significant variations in emotion interpretation across these cultural contexts, highlighting the necessity for culturally inclusive algorithms. These findings underscore the critical need for more consideration of cultural diversity in FER research, marking a crucial step toward more inclusive and culturally sensitive artificial intelligence technologies."

While signing avatar technology research has focused on legibility and appearance, there has been little attention paid to representing diversity in signing avatars, and the default is often a white female animation. We present data from focus groups conducted in two ongoing sign language machine translation projects in Europe that give insight into deaf end-users’ desires for diversity in avatar representations. Our results reveal a strong desire for full customisability, including options for representing diversity in gender expression and ethnicity, as well as accommodating sociolinguistic variation and personal identity through modified avatar signing styles. This work provides initial insights, but considerable future research is necessary, particularly with minorities and sub-groups within deaf communities."

Education is not a separate part of society; so, it is prone to changes due to globalization as well. We can see it in growing preference of the use of English, in multilingual characteristics of schools, etc. The driving forces behind globalization include advancements in communication, transportation, and technology, as well as liberalization and a variety of integration policies. An intriguing question arises regarding cultural unification: does globalization lead to the homogenization of cultures? Conversely, nationalism presents itself as an opposing phenomenon to globalization and is also a visible trend today. Nationalism emphasizes the significance of national identity and culture, seeking to preserve a nation’s unique characteristics and promote its interests. While nationalism can be viewed positively to uphold traditional values within society, it can also be perceived negatively when utilized to serve political agendas. How does globalization manifest in education? This paper initiates a discussion on the topic by first examining globalization as a phenomenon and the role of national culture in it and then delving into selected topics in the area."

2022,Choosing Where to Pursue a PhD: Ideals Sought and Compromises Made by Traditionally Minoritized Students,"Mercado Rivera, Abimelec and Artiles, Mayra S. and Cruz, Juan and Matusovich, Holly M. and Adams, Stephanie G.",10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962571,,,2022 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),,"In this Research Full Paper we explore the factors that traditionally minoritized students consider when selecting a graduate school to pursue a doctoral degree in an engineering discipline. To this end, we used case study methods to analyze the experiences of ten traditionally minoritized students through interviews conducted immediately after they had selected their graduate programs, but before they had commenced their studies. Our findings show that in choosing an institution, the most salient ideals these students hold are related to the offer of funding towards their degree and an alignment with their initial research interests. However, they described having made compromises on ideals related to their personal experience and racial identity, the most prominent being finding a faculty mentor with a similar racial background, finding a racially diverse institution, or being located in a geographical location they perceived to be more amenable to their individual identities. These findings suggest that continuing to increase the recruitment of traditionally minoritized faculty in engineering schools would have a direct impact on minoritized student recruitment, by thus helping to create spaces where more of their racial identity ideals are met and fewer compromises are made. Equally important to the recruitment of traditionally minoritized students is the transparency of funding opportunities during the recruitment and application processes, and the publication of current research opportunities within the institution."

In addition, most of the international students spent extra time reviewing the OERs and other materials placed online to prepare for in-class discussions and exams. As the higher education landscape continues to tilt towards a global, open-sourced, and inter-connected learning environment, the use of OERs will allow faculty members to help students enhance learning experiences, build strong connections with their peers, and gain greater appreciation of diverse cultures and diverse viewpoints, while in college."
2018,Resilient Multiculture Network Design in the Presence of Exploit-Triggered Correlated Failures,"Boettcher, N. and Prieto, Y. and Restrepo, S. and Pezoa, J.",10.1109/TLA.2018.8789553,,,,,"Data networks are typically equipped with the same hardware and software stacks. Correlated attacks exploiting shared vulnerabilities at the nodes may result in massive failures that disrupt network operation. In this paper, multiple correlated failures that may negatively impact a monoculture network are analyzed and a methodology to reduce their effects is proposed. The proposed methodology consists of introducing diversity into the network components by optimally selecting both the number of different network nodes and their locations within the network. First, an algorithm is proposed to introduce node diversity in the topology considering nodes' vulnerability indexes, which are associated with node vendors. Next, two different optimal node placement algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm aims to cluster nodes of the same type to maintain network connectivity, while the second seeks to maximize the network centrality metric to identify key nodes in the network. Our results show that reliability can increase up to 50% when compared to a monoculture design."
2025,Towards Inclusive Educational AI: Auditing Frontier LLMs for Cultural Biases through a Multiplexity Lens,"Mushtaq, Abdullah and Naeem, Rafay and Taj, Imran and Ghaznavi, Ibrahim and Qadir, Junaid",10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016405,,,2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),,"As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Llama 3 become integral to educational contexts, concerns are mounting over the cultural biases, power imbalances, and ethical limitations embedded within these technologies. Though generative AI tools aim to enhance learning experiences, they often reflect values rooted in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) cultural paradigms, potentially sidelining diverse global perspectives. This paper proposes a framework to assess and mitigate cultural bias within LLMs through applied multiplexity. Multiplexity, inspired by Senturk et al. and rooted in Islamic and other wisdom traditions, emphasizes the coexistence of diverse cultural viewpoints, supporting a multilayered epistemology that integrates empirical sciences and normative values. Our analysis reveals that LLMs frequently exhibit cultural polarization in both overt responses and subtle contextual cues. To address these biases, we propose two strategies: Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, which embed multiplex principles directly into the system prompt, and Multi-Agent System (MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents representing distinct cultural viewpoints collaboratively generate balanced responses. Our findings demonstrate that as mitigation strategies evolve from contextual prompting to MAS-implementation, cultural inclusivity markedly improves, evidenced by a significant rise in the Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS) and a PDS Entropy increase from 3.25% at baseline to 98% with the MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs. Sentiment analysis shows a shift towards positive sentiment across cultures, with the MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs achieving 0% negative sentiment. This study establishes a baseline for assessing and fostering cultural inclusivity in educational AI, laying the groundwork for a globally pluralistic approach that respects diverse cultural perspectives."

Users prefer easy and fast services that can be accessed everywhere such as paying utility bills and scheduling appointments. In doing so, on-line services need to be provided by governments to facilitate easy access. In this age of globalization, we live in a highly diversified world in which people from different cultural backgrounds live together. Users interactions become more appealing if cultural characteristics are incorporated into the interface design. Culture could have an important impact upon people using the web services. Thus, designing web services for a multi-cultural society will require studying in depth the effect of the society cultural characteristics. The user interface can be designed using those characteristics that help in gaining user's attention. This paper investigates the influence of culture on the user interface design of Bahrain e-Government services to examine the views of cultural effect on the user interface design. The results also show the positive and negative impact of users' culture on the interface design."
2024,InFER++: Real-World Indian Facial Expression Dataset,"Rizvi, Syed Sameen Ahmad and Seth, Aryan and Challa, Jagat Sesh and Narang, Pratik",10.1109/OJCS.2024.3443511,,,,,"Detecting facial expressions is a challenging task in the field of computer vision. Several datasets and algorithms have been proposed over the past two decades; however, deploying them in real-world, in-the-wild scenarios hampers the overall performance. This is because the training data does not completely represent socio-cultural and ethnic diversity; the majority of the datasets consist of American and Caucasian populations. On the contrary, in a diverse and heterogeneous population distribution like the Indian subcontinent, the need for a significantly large enough dataset representing all the ethnic groups is even more critical. To address this, we present InFER++, an India-specific, multi-ethnic, real-world, in-the-wild facial expression dataset consisting of seven basic expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest India-specific facial expression dataset. Our cross-dataset analysis of RAF-DB vs InFER++ shows that models trained on RAF-DB were not generalizable to ethnic datasets like InFER++. This is because the facial expressions change with respect to ethnic and socio-cultural factors. We also present LiteXpressionNet, a lightweight deep facial expression network that outperforms many existing lightweight models with considerably fewer FLOPs and parameters. The proposed model is inspired by MobileViTv2 architecture, which utilizes GhostNetv2 blocks to increase parametrization while reducing latency and FLOP requirements. The model is trained with a novel objective function that combines early learning regularization and symmetric cross-entropy loss to mitigate human uncertainties and annotation bias in most real-world facial expression datasets."

The flows increase diversity due to human contact across cultural boundaries that add complexity to Jakarta's society. Concerning the English language and culture classroom in Jakarta, the learners contribute to the diversity and bring in varieties of English language and culture. The learners are predominantly digital natives who earn English from games, media, and technology. On one hand, diversity becomes a competitive edge, though on the other hand diversity is the source of social capital in English language and culture classrooms in Jakarta. Giving room for the varieties is aligned with cosmopolitan pedagogy which allows dialogue of local diversities to ensure global community membership which is dominated by the global virtual community. The pedagogy has been put forward as a pathway towards intercultural communicative competence. Therefore, this study is interested to explore the trace of cosmopolitan pedagogy in the selected English classroom in Jakarta, Indonesia. Furthermore, this study shall reveal the reification of cosmopolitan pedagogy within the syllabus, teaching materials, language policies, and classroom practices. The result of this study shall put forward the pedagogy to nurture the digital native learners in Jakarta, Indonesia, to prepare the learners in virtual community which will dominate society 5.0."

Leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy, the study develops a multi-dimensional framework that systematically assesses LLMs across six cog-nitive domains: Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating. This benchmark ex-tends beyond traditional single-dimensional evaluations by providing a deeper analysis of LLMs' abilities to handle cul-turally specific content, ranging from basic recall of facts to higher-order cognitive tasks such as creative synthesis. Ad-ditionally, the study integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to address the challenges of minority cultural knowledge representation in LLMs, demonstrating how RAG enhances the models' performance by dynamically incorporating relevant external information. The results high-light the effectiveness of RAG in improving accuracy across all cognitive domains, particularly in tasks requiring precise retrieval and application of cultural know ledge. However, the findings also reveal the limitations of RAG in creative tasks, underscoring the need for further optimization. This benchmark provides a robust tool for evaluating and com-paring LLMs in culturally diverse contexts, offering valuable insights for future research and development in AI -driven cultural knowledge preservation and dissemination."

However, perspectives of engineering leadership are ill-defined and may vary depending on the region, school or country of residence or work. While both industry and academia concur that leadership skills are crucial to engineering graduates, there is considerable controversy over the definition of `global engineering leadership'. This lack of consensus may hinder the future formation of globally-prepared engineering leaders. This work-in-progress paper describes an exploratory study to understand how `global engineering leadership' is perceived by engineering students and faculty across worldwide institutions (predominantly across African, European, North and South American countries). The study utilizes a semi-structured survey developed from literature on national and international engineering leadership and prior work on engineering professional identity. Data was collected from two populations, the first representing students registered in engineering across worldwide institutions and the second representing engineering faculty who have demonstrated interest in leadership at their institutions. The two populations will allow scholars to compare and contrast how these perspectives changed across the different groups with the goal of developing a working definition of `global engineering leadership'. This definition may serve as a starting point to develop recommendations and strategies for engineering educators wishing to introduce their students a globalized view of engineering leadership."

2017,Pivot-Based Hybrid Machine Translation to Support Multilingual Communication,"Nasution, Arbi Haza and Syafitri, Nesi and Setiawan, Panji Rachmat and Suryani, Des",10.1109/Culture.and.Computing.2017.22,,,2017 International Conference on Culture and Computing (Culture and Computing),,"Machine Translation (MT) is very useful in supporting multicultural communication. Existing Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) which requires high quality and quantity of corpora and Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT) which requires bilingual dictionaries, morphological, syntax, and semantic analyzer are scarce for low-resource languages. Due to the lack of language resources, it is difficult to create MT from high-resource languages to low-resource languages like Indonesian ethnic languages. Nevertheless, Indonesian ethnic languages' characteristics motivate us to introduce a Pivot-Based Hybrid Machine Translation (PHMT) by combining SMT and RBMT with Indonesian as a pivot which we further utilize in a multilingual communication support system. We evaluate PHMT translation quality with fluency and adequacy as metrics and then evaluate usability of the system. Despite the medium average translation quality (3.05 fluency score and 3.06 adequacy score), the 3.71 average mean scores of the usability evaluation indicates that the system is useful to support multilingual collaboration."

In the world, India is a very multicultural and multilingual country. People of India from various regions use their own regional communication languages, making India stand at the second position in the world to have maximum languages. In India, English is provided as the second extra official language. But the usage of English in India is very less forming a communication gap. To minimize this gap by translating one language into another language is almost impossible for humans. It can be achieved by a machine translation. This paper focuses on translating Indic languages using the translation technique of Neural technology. A Sequence to Sequence model with encoder-decoder attention mechanism of neural machine translation is proposed for Telugu language conversion into English and vice versa."

The study specifically focuses on enhancing the competencies of professionals in additive manufacturing, a multidisciplinary field encompassing mechanical engineering, electronics, and computer science, to contribute to sustainable production practices. Problem-centered and guided expert interviews were conducted with 12 experts from diverse industries to accomplish this. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and Mayring's content analysis method was employed to evaluate the transcripts. This methodology identified vital competencies, including knowledge of technology and materials, part identification skills, and a comprehensive understanding of the AM process chain. The findings also highlighted the significance of soft or interpersonal skills, such as teamwork, effective communication, adapting to multicultural and diverse environments, and more. Furthermore, the interviews revealed opportunities for sustainability and emphasized the importance of increased collaboration among companies and universities involved in AM. The insights gained from this research will inform the development of training programs and guidelines to foster sustainable production in advanced manufacturing."
2020,Language-Agnostic Multilingual Modeling,"Datta, Arindrima and Ramabhadran, Bhuvana and Emond, Jesse and Kannan, Anjuli and Roark, Brian",10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9053443,,,"ICASSP 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",,"Multilingual Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) systems allow for the joint training of data-rich and data-scarce languages in a single model. This enables data and parameter sharing across languages, which is especially beneficial for the data-scarce languages. However, most state-of-the-art multilingual models require the encoding of language information and therefore are not as flexible or scalable when expanding to newer languages. Language-independent multilingual models help to address this issue, and are also better suited for multicultural societies where several languages are frequently used together (but often rendered with different writing systems). In this paper, we propose a new approach to building a language-agnostic multilingual ASR system which transforms all languages to one writing system through a many-to-one transliteration transducer. Thus, similar sounding acoustics are mapped to a single, canonical target sequence of graphemes, effectively separating the modeling and rendering problems. We show with four Indic languages, namely, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil and Kannada, that the language-agnostic multilingual model achieves up to 10% relative reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) over a language-dependent multilingual model."

As the institution becomes increasingly diverse, understanding the concept of cultural intelligence and strategies for inclusion becomes imperative for providing an inclusive environment in learning. The holistic bibliometric approach of CCC combined with big data analytics (CCC-BA) represents the method used in this research to analyze the development of CI in educational literature. Inter-cultural communication evolvement was tracked, core themes were determined, and cross-cultural communication was assessed empirically on a sample basis of multicultural student teams. The current research studied the level at which instructors can communicate cross-culturally and explored how the analytic principle can enhance teaching. Results were significant, with the reference value being 89.7% when carrying out multivariate analysis of factors that influence intercultural communication competence using big data analytical methods. The findings highlighted areas where future research was urgently required, provided practical suggestions for teachers, and demonstrated that CI leads to less cultural misunderstanding and better collaboration. They also recommended incorporating intercultural communication training into school programs for students and teachers. These results evidence the potential of raising cultural awareness at school for improving learning and teamwork in multicultural classrooms, to ensure environments that value and understand diversity."

Atif and Caton, Simon",10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3303105,,,,,"Reaching marginal and other migrant communities to elicit their political views and opinions is a well-known challenge. Social media has enabled a certain amount of online activism and participation, especially in societies with abundant multicultural identities. However, it can be quite challenging to isolate the voice of the migrant in English-speaking countries, especially with an abundance of content in English on social media. In this paper, we pursue a case study of Ireland’s Twitter landscape, specifically migrant and native activists. We present a methodology that can accurately ( $>80\%$ ) isolate the Irish migrant voice with as little as 25 English tweets without relying on user metadata and using simple, highly explainable, out-of-the-box machine learning methods. Using this, we distil (via sentiment analysis) polarities of views, segment (via BERT-based topic modelling) and summarise (via ChatGPT) differentiated views in a consumable manner for policymakers. Our approach enables policymakers to further their understanding of multicultural communities and use this to inform their decision-making processes."

Based on the Internet of Things, the music dance resource management system is analyzed, and the contribution model of fog computing resources and the allocation model of fog computing resources are established. The traditional NSGA-II (Quick Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms-II) algorithm is improved, and the improved NSGA-II algorithm is obtained to solve the resource allocation problem. Music dance resource management system is designed, implemented and tested. Through simulation and verification, the improved NSGA-II algorithm has better performance in average service delay time and average stability of task execution under different tasks and different fog nodes. In functional testing, the overall situation of music dance resource management system is good, and the design requirements are basically met. In performance testing, the response time is short and the throughput is high. Therefore, the system has high performance, and can meet the large amount of concurrent data access, which makes the user have better experience."

A massive amount of news and information is continuously available online - creating new challenges for journalists. We have developed a project-base bachelor course that introduces students to modern, professional technical journalism and advances their soft skills. Each student is required to create three features (i.e. two multimedia articles and one social media piece) that report on technology. Each created feature must contain an original multimedia component using state-of-the-art journalistic tools (e.g. videos, interactive graphics, animations). Those features that meet this requirement and fulfill journalistic standards are subsequently published online using a professional platform (i.e. WordPress). While writing in German is allowed, the use of English language is highly encouraged for crossing cultural boundaries and engaging the world-wide community. Students who are seeking a technical journalistic degree must also pass engineering courses. This concurrent technical journalism education is important for developing critical thinking and reporting. Furthermore the course increases gender-sensitivity in reporting, an important ongoing issue in a traditionally male dominated discipline."

In spite of the abundant literature addressing Lean system's technical aspects, there has been little discussion on the importance of national culture in Lean's implementation process. It has been proven that the implementation of lean practices do not always produce the intended results and national culture has been highlighted as one of the contextual variables that may explain the success or failure of Lean practices. Since companies are influenced by the culture of the country where they're located, some comparative advantages may occur due to their location, making it necessary to adjust Lean's implementation process to national culture. The purpose of this article is to propose a literature review to examine the relationship between national culture and Lean Management. This study explores the assertions and/or contradictions found in the literature regarding the cultural dimensions that may act as enablers or withholders to the lean principles and practices."

Research shows that racial and gender minority groups are more likely to experience micro-inequities, and that micro-inequities have a significant negative effect on self-esteem, work performance and career advancement. However, research on micro-inequities among software practitioners, particularly with an immigration perspective, is non-existent. To bridge this gap, we investigate the experiences of software practitioners, regarding micro-inequities from an immigration perspective. We surveyed 135 immigrant and non-immigrant software practitioners working in technical roles about verbal, nonverbal and environmental micro-inequities. Our results show that immigrants experience nine out of 27 investigated forms of micro-inequities significantly more than non-immigrants. These include not being given credit for their work, feeling excluded from key social or networking opportunities and being assumed to be less competent, assertive or intelligent. Our study can serve as an incentive for practitioners to adopt (more) inclusive work practices and to raise awareness about micro-inequities in the community.Lay Abstract: Micro-inequities are subtle, repetitive, and often unintentional forms of negative messaging, that can account for a significant burden over time. While research shows that underrepresented groups are more likely to experience micro-inequities, they have not been extensively studied in the software industry. In our work we survey 135 software practitioners regarding their experiences with micro-inequities in the software industry from an immigration perspective. Our findings show that immigrants experience some forms of micro-inequities significantly more than non-immigrants."

Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the research integrates quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to assess the impacts of music interventions before and after exposure. Initial findings indicated that both groups experienced significant reductions in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7 scale, with AI-generated music showing a greater decrease. The quantitative results revealed that after a four-week intervention, students listening to AI music exhibited a marked improvement in anxiety levels with the Chinese international school students' scores dropping from an average of 13.33 to 6.06, and the American students' scores from 14.02 to 7.28. In contrast, those who listened to pop music also showed improvements but to a lesser extent. Qualitative interviews further highlighted the personalized experience of AI music, enhancing its effectiveness in reducing stress compared to the broader appeal of pop music which was linked more to cultural resonance and social connectivity. The interaction effects analyzed through mixed linear models and F-tests showed statistically significant differences in the impact of music types across cultures. This study underscores the potential of personalized AI-driven music interventions in mental health strategies tailored for diverse cultural contexts, suggesting a paradigm shift towards more customized therapeutic approaches in global mental health education."
2024,Innovative Ideas and Academic Realpolitik: Building Global Competence Development into a European University Alliance,"Kjellgren, Björn",10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893174,,,2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),,"This work-in-progress innovative paper outlines the development of a recently adopted policy on multilingualism and multiculturalism to enhance global competence in engineering education within one of the first European University Alliances (EUA), comprising nine universities from nine European Union countries. The policy represents a creative and ambitious response to not only the call to embed such competencies in curricula but also to invite all stakeholders in the alliance to become agents of change in order to leverage existing linguistic and cultural assets in all their work. In terms of content, the policy builds on and extends a rich foundation of established scholarship on the development of intercultural, plurilingual, and global competence in engineering education and fills a gap in current educational practice by operationalizing these concepts in the context of a EUA. Applying complex systems theory, the paper describes how the policy's development, endorsement, and planned implementation reveal the complex interactions among multiple stakeholders within the EUA's organizational ecosystem and its constituent institutions. By highlighting the policy's potential to catalyze adaptive change and foster resilience within the system, as well as to inspire actors outside the Alliance, the policy not only addresses immediate educational needs but also anticipates the challenges of engineering education and practice in a world characterized by cultural and linguistic diversity, and confronts a reality in which such diversity is not universally celebrated as a beneficial resource, despite the European Union's motto of “united in diversity.” The policy is further supported by an innovative guide for implementation, offering practical activities for individual growth, collaborative engagement, and community enhancement, embodying the policy's comprehensive approach to fostering global competence through multilingualism and multiculturalism. While the content of the policy is well aligned with the explicit goals of the Alliance and the broader European Union project ethos of which the EUAs are a part, the policy is deliberately general in its description of its agenda to allow for flexibility in responding to the different local contexts, challenges, resources, and priorities of the Alliance's partner universities, none of which have a policy as ambitious as that of the Alliance. While the policy is closely linked to and must be seen in the context of the emergence and partly unpredictable future development of the Alliance, the built-in non-linearity of its implementation makes it vulnerable to factors at play within the Alliance that could effectively nullify the implementation of the policy or reinforce negative feedback loops that serve to maintain the status quo at partner universities. While the trajectory of the policy demonstrates the importance of initiatives at both the individual and group levels, the realization of the policy and its prescribed practices ultimately depends on political decisions within the Alliance and within the educational leadership of the European Union, where an agreed vision for the future of EUAs has yet to crystallize."

Recent work in facial analysis and recognition have thus started making use of synthetic datasets generated from GANs and diffusion based generative models. These models, however, lack fairness in terms of demographic representation and can introduce the same biases in the trained downstream tasks. This can have serious societal and security implications. To address this issue, we propose a methodology that generates unbiased data from a biased generative model using an evolutionary algorithm. We show results for StyleGAN2 model trained on the Flicker Faces High Quality dataset to generate data for singular and combinations of demographic attributes such as Black and Woman. We generate a large racially balanced dataset of 13.5 million images, and show that it boosts the performance of facial recognition and analysis systems whilst reducing their biases.

In contexts that are new to the phenomenon, there may be an occasion to revise the protocols and models for the development of new spatial relationships, based on the presence of communities that are no longer homogeneous. The theme of urban regeneration due to the presence of migrant communities has been addressed in various ways and from different points of view, often focusing on the creation of urban spaces capable of improving livability, rarely with the creation of integration processes or the construction of new urban identities. However, a resilient point of view, in ecological and social terms, can allow a new perspective on the way in which the multiple presence of communities that are no longer “original” has radically changed the sense of urban space. This contribution reports some experimental experiences on how the city and the community in progress can develop a coordinated system of actions able to act on the theme of reception and integration, working in the perspective of urban resilience and acting on social policies and on the spatial relevance of integration programs. Through cooperative learning, in a process of applied research with experts in the social habit of four Sicilian cities (Ragusa, Catania, Caltanissetta, and Palermo) the tested integration policies will be evaluated not in terms of melting pot, but in terms of identifying identity spaces able to build a sense of community."

The use of ontologies, such as the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO), plays a crucial role in organizing and managing the skills required for modern engineering roles. However, the slow pace of ontology updates and the lack of contextual adaptability present significant challenges, leading to outdated and irrelevant information for educators, learners, and industry professionals. This paper explores the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge engineering to accelerate the process of updating ontologies like ESCO. By dynamically analyzing data and incor-porating contextual information, LLMs offer promising avenues for enhancing the evolution and precision of these ontologies. We discuss the potential impact of this approach in engineering education, particularly in aligning ups killing and reskilling efforts with the demands of emerging technologies such as AI -driven automation and digital engineering. This paper aims to highlight how LLMs can support the creation of more responsive, context-aware learning frameworks, ultimately sustaining educational ex-cellence and fostering critical thinking in engineering education."

Such a changing landscape in higher education opens up some opportunities for pedagogical design in technical and professional communication. Scholars have argued for teaching technical and professional communication as a humanistic, communalist, and interpretative process. Drawing on the prior scholarships, I propose a cross- cultural team project in a technical and professional communication class with native English speakers, multilingual students, and international students. In this team project students are not expected to land on cultural generalizations. Instead, students are encouraged to apply, appropriate, and “amend” existing linguistic and cultural theories in the decision-making of designing product description and instructions for a foreign audience. The ultimate goal of this intercultural communication practice is to guide student to understand and connect a cultural audience with information in a specific time and place."

Serious games offer unique avenues for fostering diversity in schools. JOINclusion, an Erasmus + funded project, developed and tested a mobile game across Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands. The game aims to facilitate harmonious and prosocial interactions in multicultural school settings. It consists of two learning scenarios, each consisting of four levels, each one targeting specific Social Emotional Learning (SEL) skills. Furthermore, a collaborative level is implemented, which allows children to practice the skills strengthened in the previous two scenarios. Thanks to a captivating and entertaining plot, children will have to search for magical gems scattered throughout the various rooms of the school and collaboratively solve social dilemmas based on the game's levels to save the school from an evil witch who is intent on destroying it. Additionally, an easy-to-use authoring tool for school educators has been developed to generate customized materials for the collaborative level. This study presents initial findings from the game's pilot phase, assessing its usability and educational value among children. Additionally, leveraging machine learning, the study examines children's game interactions to group them based on similar patterns. This grouping has the potential to predict behaviors related to social inclusion and identify influential game interaction features. Teachers can then use this information to gain a better understanding of how to create an enriching game experience and a more inclusive school environment. The results revealed that students who played the game enjoyed the experience, expressed a desire to play it again, and acquired new skills and knowledge. Cluster analysis showed three interaction profiles potentially predictive of expected behaviors and influential game features.

Whereas the traditional style of lecturing is still largely used in this field, hands-on, practical and interactive approaches have repeatedly proven to be more effective. This short paper is based on the experience of using such a teaching approach in a multicultural software engineering classroom, by considering the additional challenges brought by interacting with colleagues from different cultural backgrounds and speaking in a common, foreign language. The strategies employed throughout the course will be highlighted, along with various lessons learned, to be integrated in future software engineering classes."

2017,Improving communication in multicultural teams — A web-based model and its application in project management education,"Motschnig, Renate and Güver, Seyhan",10.1109/FIE.2017.8190448,,,2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),,"Technical solution skills - though important - are not enough for effective, multicultural teamwork. Despite broad consensus on the vital function of communication- and social skills, they tend to be underrepresented in the training of software-engineers and project managers. This is partly because such skills are less explicit than technical methods, tools, and artefacts. To address this deficiency, an openly accessible web-based communication model for multicultural teams (comMCT) was developed. It consists of four modules addressing structural, functional, organizational, and interpersonal/behavioral aspects of multicultural communication. After presenting the empirically validated comMCT model, two scenarios of introducing comMCT into two academic courses within the computer science curriculum at the University of Vienna are discussed, along with the students' reactions and an online questionnaire capturing students' feedback on comMCT. In a nutshell, thoughtful, person-centered application of the model is expected to enhance learners' knowledge, practice, and reflection on communication issues and contribute to more effective and satisfied multicultural teams. Importantly, instructors as well as life-long learning program designers will find inspiration on including comMCT into their courses."

However, evaluating student's trust and satisfaction of the system are not fully investigated. In this research, a sample of 634 students participated in the study from Cyprus International University, Cyprus. The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique was employed with AMOS 23 software to identify the trust and satisfaction of students' SIS usage. The study model, which include subjective norm, image, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, trust and satisfaction, was developed based on extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM II). Results obtained from the analysis indicated that image, output quality, result demonstrability and perceived ease of use had a significant impact on perceived usefulness. Trust was found to be significantly correlated with satisfaction; however, subjective norm, Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use did not have a significant influence on satisfaction. Furthermore, the finding confirmed that several constructs in the TAM II that were important in previous studies were not significant in the SIS. The students' behavior aspects are essential for the effective use of the system. It provides valuable information for university management in understanding the challenges of student's trust and satisfaction about SIS usage."

Based on the current situation of multicultural education in China, the thesis presents ideas for constructing a college English teaching model from three aspects. First, correct cultural teaching value is significant. For example, understanding and innovation of multi-culture influence the model construction of college English teaching under the multi-culture background. Second, clear teaching goals, teaching channels and English classroom groups are good for diversifying teaching strategies, which is also an important content of the college English teaching model. Thirdly, we need to establish a scientific cultural evaluation mechanism, enrich cultural connotation under the perspective of multicultural development, and expand ways for the college English teaching model. Constructing these three aspects of English teaching in colleges and universities is of reference value for Chinese English education."

Whereas most captive cetaceans cannot survive if released directly into the ocean a viable alternative is to transfer them from tanks to authentic sanctuaries. An authentic cetacean sanctuary is a place that provides a combination of a complex, natural environment continuous with the ocean and human care. Key to wildlife sanctuaries is the promotion of autonomy and giving back as much as one can of what was taken from its residents. In this presentation we describe the Whale Sanctuary Project (WSP), the world's first cetacean sanctuary effort for both captive beluga whales and orcas. Founded in 2016, WSP is a non-profit organization representing a groundbreaking collaboration among scientists, engineers, dolphin and whale advocates, legal experts, and many others. Its mission is to create a sanctuary for captive orcas and beluga whales in Canada and aid other cetacean sanctuary efforts globally. The WSP is preparing a 100-acre site on the eastern shore of Nova Scotia to welcome whales in 2025. Herein we describe the sanctuary site, highlight and update some of the milestones and challenges WSP has met over the years as the sanctuary progresses towards completion. We also discuss the importance of local community encouragement and participation for such a project as well as engagement with First Nations, who share the goal of rectifying our relationship with the ocean and the animals who live in it."

These POGIL activities were designed to regularly prompt students to reflect on the relevance of the curriculum to their own lives, but instructors did not successfully incorporate students' cultures into their classes. Students were significantly more comfortable with computers after taking the course with the POGIL activities, even compared to students taking a similar course from the same instructors. However, there was no overall effect on students' attitudes towards the role of computers in their lives or their interest in taking more CS classes. Based on the instructors' implementations, the authors developed “Levels of Student Participation and Stages of Relevant Curriculum” to help all POGIL faculty assess how to make their classrooms more inclusive and make their curriculum more relevant. As instructors become more reflective about their practices and gain experience with POGIL, the authors expect that these POGIL activities and practices will improve students' attitudes towards computing and students' interest in CS careers."

Guided by the social constructivism paradigm and using critical race theory (CRT) as a theoretical framework that places race at the center of educational research and discourse, we provide conditions for the successful implementation of the case study as a teaching and learning strategy for culturally responsive, inclusive education that may improve academic learner performance for indigenous students. After receiving an Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program grant, one institution provided distributed, community-based instruction to rural areas and fostered a community of practice to support pre-service school library teachers. This article presents approaches and assessments based on the program that incorporated a culturally responsive pedagogy in its specialized curriculum and created information literacy resources to improve student success in racially diverse and economically disadvantaged northeast Oklahoma schools and communities. The article further reviews factors that influenced learning and teaching in this program. Significant contributions include the creation of a unique program that provides a framework for practicing professionals in K-12. Curriculum, resources, and information literacy tools are made available to help sustain educational efforts for those who serve in similar communities. The planning, design, development and distribution of digital format information literacy modules address education-based needs to enhance information literacy skills, to incorporate “faces of diversity” that help targeted viewers personally relate more positively to the learning experience, and to deliver current “standards based” training resources. Lesson plans and learning resources created during and after the program can continue to provide opportunities for cross-cultural dialogue between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous educators in shared study, mentoring, and faculty/teacher training."

In a multicultural nation like Malaysia, people like to use codeswitch sentences, through which they mix several languages to express their opinions. Sentiment analysis can be used to classify the subjectivity of social media data, by considering the multilingual aspect of Malaysian users who may experience disaster. In this paper, the authors propose a multilingual sentiment classifier used to understand how Malaysians react during a disaster. The proposed model collects disaster data from social media, which is then classified through a deep learning algorithm, so as to analyze the sentiments of people affected by disasters. The experiment results show that a multilingual sentiment classifier can achieve 0.862 accuracy and 0.864 F1-score which is considered suitable for analyzing social media data. The classification result shows that most Malaysians use social media to disseminate information during disaster periods."

Intercultural learning is a global competence concept which is necessary for engineers to be able to work on complex global projects; immigrate to find work; collaborate and compete with multicultural colleagues; and work for international companies. Higher education institutions are exploring how to support and develop intercultural competences in students; however, in the engineering discipline studies are limited. Traditional study-abroad approaches have been adversely impacted by global events and challenges such as safety issues, health concerns, natural disasters, and political instability as well as students' financial and time constraints. In response, engineering education institutions and programs are exploring how to harness technology to satisfy academic and labor market needs in a scalable manner. This paper introduces the use of the Knowledge Community and Inquiry (KCI) pedagogical model developed by Slotta to design an inter-cultural learning course for student participants in the International Virtual Engineering Student Teams (InVEST) project. InVEST uses a blend of online social and collaborative experiential learning and synchronous video meetings to support students and educators involved in the project. The InVEST pilot project is aimed at bringing globally dispersed educators and their engineering students together to engage in cross-institutional and collaborative project-based learning via an online learning environment. The course is designed to assist students in gaining an appreciation of diverse cultures and working together on a project to co-construct new cross-cultural understanding."

It enriches ideas, drives economic growth, and preserves cultural heritage. To promote global cultural education, we propose a solution using big data and smart technology through crane machines equipped with dolls dressed in traditional costumes. These dolls are interactive, collecting text and speech data from users. By using sentiment analysis, we can better understand the emotional and interactive needs of users. We introduce a text sentiment analysis model based on multi-head attention and multi-scale CNN. The data undergoes preprocessing, and BERT generates word vectors. BILSTM and multi-attention mechanisms capture contextual dependencies, while multi-scale CNNs extract local text features to detect sentiment polarity. These features are fused to create a new feature vector for prediction. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end speech sentiment analysis model (EML) based on multi-task learning. Speech is processed through the Wav2Vec2.0 pre-training model to obtain temporal feature representations. In training, the model simultaneously performs speech translation and sentiment classification. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach."

2024,Optimization of User-Centric Step Indicator for Digital Banking Interface,"Huang, Yi-Ting and Wang, Tzu-Hsuan and Lin, Cian-Yu",10.1109/ICCE-Taiwan62264.2024.10674275,,,2024 International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Taiwan (ICCE-Taiwan),,"Step indicators show users how far they have progressed in a multi-step process and are thus an essential element of interface design. However, research on step indicators is lacking, and optimizing these indicators in cellphone interfaces is essential to maximize their benefits to create a better user experience (UX). The focus of this study was banking apps. Through interviews with six financial experts and experts on user interface (UI) and UX, combined with prototyping and questionnaire surveys, we sought a balance between user-centered design and practical needs. The results show that step indicators are most effective when tasks are divided into more than three stages. Experts affirmed their effectiveness in reducing user anxiety and provided appropriate design solutions based on different step counts and language contexts. This study not only deepens our understanding of step indicators for different applications but also provides vital design guidelines for designers of mobile banking interfaces to enhance UX in multilingual and multicultural environments."

2024,Intercultural Readiness: Mapping Effective Teamwork Strategies in Engineering Teams to the Intercultural Development Continuum,"Chhikara, Alankrita and Lapka, Samantha and Jesiek, Brent K. and Kung, Franki Y. H.",10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10892844,,,2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),,"This research paper explores the experiences of engineering students and professionals in multicultural teams, aiming to understand successful strategies for working in such environments. With the engineering field diversifying rapidly due to globalization, there is a growing need for engineers to possess cross-cultural communication and collaboration skills alongside technical knowledge. This study aims to improve the effectiveness of engineering education and addresses the evolving needs for engineering education and the role of educators in preparing future engineers for multicultural teamwork. The following research questions guided our study: (i). What strategies do engineering students and professionals hold and employ in navigating multicultural teamwork?, and (ii) How do these specific strategies mentioned by engineering students and professionals align with the developmental orientations on the Intercultural Developmental Continuum (IDC)? The study employed a qualitative approach, with interviews and focus groups conducted with 41 engineering students and 17 professionals who reported prior experience working on multicultural teams. Participants discussed their experiences and strategies, which were categorized into social behavioral, cognitive, and affective attitudinal themes. A total of 17 strategy types were identified in the student data and 16 types in the professional data. Strategies were in turn mapped to different developmental orientations on the IDC, showing a relationship between strategies described by participants and associated stages of intercultural development. Our findings reveal likely gaps in multicultural teamwork abilities among both students and professionals. More specifically, engineering students and professionals may benefit from expanded intercultural development training to foster more ethnorelative approaches to teamwork. Future research could involve participants completing the IDI survey before interviews to better understand their individual levels of intercultural development, followed by efforts to design and pilot training and educational materials aligned with particular intercultural development levels. This research contributes to understanding successful strategies for working in multicultural teams, benefiting educators, practitioners, and engineering students alike."
2021,A model for experiential learning by replicating a workplace environment in virtual classes,"Efthymiou, Leonidas and Ktoridou, Despo and Epaminonda, Epaminondas",10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453966,,,2021 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),,"Experiential learning has been a core notion in higher education for nearly half a century. However, the application of experiential learning practices on virtual classes is somewhat limited. In this paper, we test different practices of experiential learning intended for online learning. We draw on electronic end-of-module surveys, which have been completed by students upon completion of the class. The sample concerns the completed questionnaires of 197 post-graduate students. Based on these findings, we present a three-pillar model which relies on a) online communities, b) learning-by-doing as part of continuous assessment and, c) multicultural teamwork, to promote experiential learning by replicating a `workplace environment'."
2018,Using cultural heterogeneity to improve soft skills in engineering and computer science education,"Andersson, Christina and Logofatu, Doina",10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363227,,,2018 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),,"If an engineer obtains correct conclusions, but cannot communicate these results in a proper way, then the value of the achievements could be diminishing dramatically. Awareness about the importance of acquiring soft skills in addition to technical knowledge is often present in engineering education, but the issue is still how the improvement of these key competencies should be addressed. Often our engineering classes are heterogeneous, both with respect to pre-knowledge of the mathematical and technical skills, but also concerning the cultural background of the students. This can be an additional challenge for the teaching situation. Instead of considering the cultural heterogeneity as an obstacle, we decided to use it as an advantage for enhancing soft skills in a mathematics course. In this paper, we describe a multicultural-based teaching approach for improving soft skills in engineering and computer science education."

In order to improve the convergence of data, multi-objective processing is carried out in the cloud computing environment. Combined with the fuzzy adaptive sorting algorithm, the difference value of multi-objective variation is calculated to achieve the balanced adjustment of variation data. In order to speed up the data convergence, balance the local optimal sorting value, obtain the initial value of scattered defect data, and complete the adaptive sorting of scattered defect big data. Finally, experiments show that the adaptive sorting method based on cloud computing can better repair and accurately sort the scattered data, and improve the data convergence effect."

Very often this is the English language, that simplifies the communication, but does not dismiss the cultural differences between different national cultures and inside other cultural groups. In our contribution, we will concentrate on the cultural influence on teaching databases. Open questions that we want to discuss are: Which cultural viewpoints have to be considered (national, different users' groups); how culture influences expert work; and finally, yet importantly, do we have general solutions for those open questions? Besides the presentation of basic cultural concepts like culture, cultural differences, cultural awareness and others, we will also present the experiences of a student test group and students from the Erasmus+ program, who answered the question about cultural viewpoint inclusion into conceptual modelling (local students), or take part in the interview (Erasmus students)."

Some believe that strengthening the basic skill sets of students in math [1] will raise awareness of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in the United States. While others find other issues such as debt cause a large influence in lack of persistence in STEM programs, both graduate and undergraduate.[2, 3] A review of the data available on engineering technology and other technology graduate students provides clarity to the diversity issue. While the authors found some students progress onto graduate school, nearly 60% were enrolled in the 3/2 programs. These are programs where students complete a bachelor and master degree in 5 years. Our study also showed students, primarily those that are a minority by race or gender, do not continue their education through graduate school. These findings raise some questions about these students and what steps will encourage their persistence or return to graduate study. Therefore, further examination of available data, future interviews with current students and graduates will provide a better understanding of the lack of diversification and persistence in technology graduate programs. Utilization of data gathered in the large institutional database provides a means to understand how the perception of students influences their decision to persist, continue, and complete further study. Increased understanding as it relates to students decisions to persist allows institutions to develop strategies to change student perceptions and decisions to persist. Administration will then have the information needed to support the development of programs that will encourage persistence and greater diversification of the graduate student population in technology."

The lecture aims to approach the question of fake news in history, which methods were used and what lessons can we learn from them nowadays in the times of digitalization and information overflow.The contribution focuses on migration, as an example on the case study of Sudeten Germans. Here we can see the transformation of a close relationship between ethnic as well as linguistic groups over centuries into national hatred. News, fake news and propaganda played an essential role in these developments. In the break of culture of National Socialism and the resulting post- war violence, this culminated in the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia. These developments led to friend and foe schemes over generations until today - which are expressed offline as well as online."

These deficiencies were highlighted by COVID-19 with the online classes. In this study, we propose an active learning activity to improve students’ understanding of business concepts. We applied the activity in an online class, at a renowned university in Portugal, to first-year students from management and economics courses. Students answered a quiz, before and after the activity, to measure the level of comprehension of the topic. The high scores of the post-quiz reflect the good acquisition of knowledge. The survey found that most students (96%) agree that active learning methods can be more efficient at acquiring and understanding management concepts. Students also raised several positive points about active learning methods."

Traditionally, contact-based method such as PPG requiring skin attachment have been predominant. However, these methods have limitations due to their invasive nature. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a non-contact alternative that broadens its application possibilities. Yet, current rPPG methods have not been extensively tested across diverse populations, where varying skin pigmentation can affect measurement accuracy. This study aims to determine the most effective rPPG method for extracting heart rate from individuals of diverse origins. Evaluating Chrominance-based (CHROM), Plane Orthogonal to Skin (POS), and GREEN methods using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), we found that the POS method demonstrated superior predictive accuracy with an RMSE of 8.45, while GREEN showed comparable performance with an RMSE of 8.89 across different country groups."

To address this problem the authors developed culturally relevant class activities and homework problems that teach students to use loops, lists, functions and conditional logic, by remixing popular Black music in an introductory Python course. The activities were developed with the thought that students would be less intimidated by the content, if they saw their culture reflected in the course materials. Using an online survey, students were asked to compare their experience working on the problems that used Black music as a context, with their experience completing textbook problems on the same content. All of the survey respondents were Black female undergraduate students enrolled in a STEM major at a historically black college. Students reported that they were better able to identify with the examples and problems using Black Music as a context. Study participants also indicated that making enjoyable music motivated them to work harder than they would on textbook problems. Of the 33 study participants, 60% had no prior experience programming, and 63% of the students expressed an interest in taking further computer science coursework as an elective. The authors explain the sequence of assignments they used to help students understand introductory computer science concepts, and share lessons learned from using Black Music as a tool in the classroom."

This paper explores the multifaceted impacts of globalization on engineering education, examining both the challenges and opportunities it presents. The globalization of engineering education is reshaping curricula, teaching methodologies, and the skills demanded of future engineers. We examine the significance, benefits, and challenges of international activities for engineering students, such as study abroad programs, international internships, and collaborative projects with institutions worldwide. The impact of international experiences on students' technical skills, cultural awareness, adaptability, and overall professional development is described. The findings indicate that international activities offer invaluable opportunities for students to broaden their horizons, gain exposure to diverse engineering practices, and develop essential soft skills required in today's globalized engineering landscape. The role of international collaborations in fostering innovation, promoting interdisciplinary learning, and addressing global engineering challenges is presented. The challenges discussed relate to cultural diversity, curriculum standardization, and the integration of global perspectives into local contexts. This paper concludes with recommendations for curriculum development, pedagogical practices, and policy initiatives aimed at promoting a globally competent engineering workforce equipped to address the complex challenges of the 21st century."

These regulations have turned much of the attention towards the improvement of boardroom diversity particularly after economic turmoil 2007–08. Malaysia like other countries, also recommended improving boardroom diversity in its recently introduced third CG code (Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance) in 2012. Thus, this paper proposes to investigate boardroom diversity (age, gender & ethnicity) and its relation with shareholders' confidence measured by share market price in the non-financial listed companies of Malaysia from 2010 to 2013. The proposed period of analysis represents two years pre and two years post enactment period of the code which will highlight the impact of the code, if any. The proposed study will fill the literature gap as most of the previous literature in the area has investigated the relationship between boardroom diversity and firm performance rather than shareholders' confidence."

Today, all geophysical disciplines utilize remote sensing applications in some form or another, and the trend in such usage is certainly expected to be positive going forward. It is, therefore, critical that the next generation of remote sensing tool developers and users be adequately attracted, recruited, retained, and trained to meet current 21st century environmental challenges and those challenges that lie ahead. It is also equally important (for a plethora of reasons) that this prospective new cohort of remote sensing developers and users be both ethnically diverse and highly skilled. To this end, the New York City College of Technology (City Tech) of the City University of New York has used a National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (NSF REU) grant to develop and implement an intrusive remote sensing research mentoring program that targets minority students. Programmatic results indicate that the remote sensing mentoring program has been highly successful in increasing the mentees' remote sensing knowledge and research skills, their communication of remote sensing concepts and ideas, and their research creativity, autonomy, and intellect."

A change in the learning paradigm implies the development of metaskills and metaknowledge. Implementing Federal State Educational Standards (FSES) of the third generation also reinforces the need to study and develop metacompetences and metaskills for students in order to be competitive in the labor market and in demand as specialists. Metacompetences as some new qualities that develop on the basis of the basic professional and personal qualities necessary to improve efficiency, work capacity or learning ability are inextricably linked with metacognitive processes. The development of the ability to manage one’s cognitive processes can be implemented using teaching methods aimed at the student’s independent activity. The project method is one of these teaching methods. Project activity in higher education is a part of innovation activity. Implemented in different directions, project activity at the university contribute to the development of the required competences by students in terms of the ability to design and innovative activity, and can also be the basis for innovation in the areas of specialization of the university."

International project teams working in such an environment should deal with issues connected with differences in time-zones, technology compatibility, communication [1], etc. Furthermore, project team members come from different cultural backgrounds, which is why, in multi-cultural projects, an individual may need to navigate multiple cultural and value norms [2]. Such cultural dimensions as trust and fears, lack of participation and commitment, and insufficient information sharing are reported to influence project team work, too [3]. Competence management exercises the notion of competence for different purposes, for example, in assessment and development centers, and for learning and development needs [4]. However, there is a lack in the literature on how to deal with challenges and issues that appear in international project teams in a multi-cultural environment. In this paper, the author analyzes existing competency-based frameworks and approaches and studies factors that play a role in managing international project teams. The findings show that a competency-based approach can be used to mitigate cultural misunderstandings with the help of the intercultural competence profile that is related to the respective competence elements mentioned in competence-based standards."

The interest in fashion can vary according to the country, region, culture, age, seasons, climates, places visited, attitude, personal interests etc. Some of them, however, have difficulties finding out about suitable dressing styles for them. Meeting this need is the purpose of this application. On the other hand, social networks are an easy way to interact with the teenagers. In this new age social network site, users create a profile and enter their body measurements to create a virtual model of the particular user. They can also upload their photos to create a complete virtual model which includes face as well. It was necessary to add business value to the application along with the usual entertainment factors. Adding business value to entertainment factors is the main attraction in Fashion Fit to suit a new age of social networking."
2018,A New Clustering-based Thresholding Method for Human Skin Segmentation Using HSV Color Space,"Feitosa, Rafael Divino Ferreira and Soares, Anderson da Silva and Pereyra, Lucas Calabrez",10.1109/ISCC.2018.8538604,,,2018 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC),,"Skin detection based on color can be applied in eHealth systems for preventive healthcare and computer-aided diagnosis. These algorithms could be incorporated in acquisition and preprocessing steps of the applications that assist with skincare, as prevention and detection of melanoma. In this paper we present the results of a study that investigated the reduction of the color spectrum in the HSV system for sample-based skin detection of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The proposed HSV filter reduced the color spectrum by 97.4648% so as to select candidates for human skin tones. It achieved low sensitivity (54.6333%) and high specificity (92.6390%) in human skin detection in color digital images when compared to the performance of other algorithms proposed in the literature. Different from other filters described in the literature which propose a single interval for human skin in the HSV system, this model presents and discusses 13 intervals in the possible spectrum which present a well-defined variation in terms of tone."
2017,Increasing network reliability to correlated failures through optimal multiculture design,"Prieto, Yasmany and Pezoa, Jorge E. and Boettcher, Nicolás and Sobarzo, Sergio K.",10.1109/CHILECON.2017.8229516,,,"2017 CHILEAN Conference on Electrical, Electronics Engineering, Information and Communication Technologies (CHILECON)",,"Monoculture in a computer network is defined as executing the same protocols and software on all the networking devices. Multiple, correlated failures may be triggered in a monoculture network by attacks that exploit existing vulnerabilities in either protocols, software, or hardware. In this paper, optimal multiculture network design is used to improve the network reliability in the presence of correlated attacks. The multiculture network design is formalized using two sequential optimization problems: The first one for optimally selecting the number of network devices from each available vendor at the design stage, and the second one for optimally placing the devices in the network topology. Results show the capability of multiculture design in improving network reliability of eight actual topologies."
2020,Food Genre Classification from Food Images by Deep Neural Network with Tensorflow and Keras,"Samraj, Andrews and D., Sowmiya and K.A., Deepthisri and R., Oviya",10.1109/ITT51279.2020.9320870,,,2020 Seventh International Conference on Information Technology Trends (ITT),,"Different varieties of food and its quality speak the culinary tendencies and religious beliefs of people from different regions of the world. The food reflects culture and each food uses unique and combination of ingredients. It is a fashion and trend now a day to develop new food varieties, cooking methods and trying out cross culture recipe. Handling the food serving for a multi ethnic, multi culture and different belief people in a common environment like conferences, air lines, quarantine centers, even refugee camps etc. is a challenge and need concentration and attention. A safer way of using untiring intelligent machines to replace the food distribution to ease and protect chefs and kitchen staff is felt essential. We developed a system of intelligent visual food identification in order to avoid errors that may happen when handling big numbers of food distribution by deploying smart machines. We choose 17 assorted varieties of food images and trained the system to identify its correct type and nature. We used Convolution Neural Network with Tensor-flow and Keras and trained the network with 170 different food images. We trained the system with online and offline images and achieved training accuracy of percentage. The experiment results show 80 percentages and are not only limited to single entity but describing multiple possible labeling of food according to its nature."
2022,A closer look to STEM education across continents: insights from a multicultural panel discussion,"Roehrig, Gillian and El-Deghaidy, Heba and García-Holgado, Alicia and Kansan, Dilek",10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766669,,,2022 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),,"The labor market increasingly demands workers with STEM skills, not only knowledge and skills related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics, but also transversal skills associated with STEM education; critical thinking, creativity and problem solving are some of the skills demanded in workers and that STEM approaches seek to integrate. There are different models of STEM education according to the level of integration of the four disciplines. Moreover, educational systems are different depending on the country and associated external factors that affect the teaching processes. For this reason, the implementation of STEM education differs between countries. In this context, it is necessary to exchange ideas and experiences among the different regions in order to identify best practices and work together for improving STEM education. This work presents the results of a multicultural panel that was organized in Turkey to explore the differences and similarities between four countries from different continents: Egypt, United States of America (USA), Spain, and Turkey."
2021,The Many Faces of Anger: A Multicultural Video Dataset of Negative Emotions in the Wild (MFA-Wild),"Javadi, Roya and Lim, Angelica",10.1109/FG52635.2021.9666994,,,2021 16th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2021),,"The portrayal of negative emotions such as anger can vary widely between cultures and contexts, depending on the acceptability of expressing full-blown emotions rather than suppression to maintain harmony. The majority of emotional datasets collect data under the broad label “anger”, but social signals can range from annoyed, contemptuous, angry, furious, hateful, and more. In this work, we curated the first in-the-wild multicultural video dataset of emotions, and deeply explored anger-related emotional expressions by asking culture-fluent annotators to label the videos with 6 labels and 13 emojis in a multi-label framework. We provide a baseline multi-label classifier on our dataset, and show how emojis can be effectively used as a language-agnostic tool for annotation."
2021,"Group Reports in the Online Platform: A Puzzle, a Ride in the Park or a Steep Slope: A Case Study of Multicultural Undergraduate Students in the United Arab Emirates","Hysaj, Ajrina",10.1109/TALE52509.2021.9678835,,,"2021 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology & Education (TALE)",,"Completion of group reports in multicultural classes in remote learning can be daunting for students and instructors. Although the needs and responsibilities of both parties differ, they effectively meet in the designing of appropriate assessment tasks and in the successful completion of the same. The process of group work in the online platform, as well as the challenges and possibilities presented to students and instructors differ from those of the face-to-face platform. The goal of the instructors and students is the completion of group tasks to achieve the intended learning outcomes and the successful academic satisfaction of undergraduate students. This paper addresses the efficacy of conducting research and completing group reports in academic study skills classes in the online platform, and it aims to explore the perception of undergraduate students towards the experience conducting research and completing questionnaires with the help of online tools. A sample size of fifty-eight undergraduate students were surveyed using a Likert-scale survey and the same students participated in completing reflective tasks, explaining their experience of conducting research and completing group reports using online tools. The findings revealed a set of positive and negative aspects of online collaboration; however, the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. The study findings can be useful for practitioners and curriculum designers of a variety of subjects and especially those of academic writing classes as it sheds light on the benefits and challenges of collaborative learning for completion of group reports in the online platform."
2017,Intercultural engineering online: Getting humanitarian engineering on the agenda,"van de Vegte, Joyce",10.1109/IHTC.2017.8058205,,,2017 IEEE Canada International Humanitarian Technology Conference (IHTC),,"Engineers and technologists are essential to solving many of the planet's most pressing problems; among them: clean water, sanitation, access to energy, carbon reduction, built infrastructure, disaster relief, transportation, and sustainable agriculture. These issues are headlines in the domain referred to as “humanitarian engineering”. Yet, despite the urgency, the majority of engineers do not spend their careers solving the problems where need is greatest. In what ways can young engineers be drawn towards working on the critical challenges being faced by so many people worldwide? By what means can a feeling of professional responsibility or duty be inculcated? How can the goals of humanitarian engineering be linked to young engineers' views of their own careers? This paper reviews one effort to address these questions by way of an online course linking questions of cultural dimensions, multicultural teams, and intercultural communication to humanitarian engineering, sustainable development goals (SDGs), and engineers' social responsibility. Pre- and post-assessments reveal several statistically significant trends that suggest the online course, entitled “Intercultural Engineering,” has some efficacy in shifting students' perspectives. As such, it appears to be a useful tool in supporting SDG 17, which seeks to revitalize global partnerships for sustainable development through shared values, visions, and goals."
