2024,5 - Framework part II: artificial intelligence + political economics,Dominique J. Monlezun,https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-443-21597-1.00005-6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443215971000056,Morgan Kaufmann,Responsible Artificial Intelligence Re-engineering the Global Public Health Ecosystem,Dominique J. Monlezun,"This chapter considers the political economic or meta-determinants of health for the global public health ecosystem, critical for the scale, scope, and speed of coordinated actions (including in consensus-based governance and financing) to generate equitable and effective global health solutions to urgent shared challenges. Rising international separation and tensions between democracies and autocracies in addition to the Global North and the Global South undermines the health of these regimes and regions and that of humanity. This chapter thus considers global health and artificial intelligence (AI) in their political economic context in the strategic competition of dominant power players, particularly with the governments, militaries, and corporations of the United States and China which account for most of the global health financing and programs along with that of AI’s development and deployment. Failures in managed strategic competition can not only undermine the cooperation required for the AI-driven global public health ecosystem, but they may even imperil it through accelerated and even catastrophic conflicts. This chapter therefore considers the history and foreseeable future of the global public health ecosystem from the structural perspective of political economics, including the underlying values that may provide a durable foundation for coordinated health action. It additionally considers emergent solutions and advances for the health ecosystem toward this including with human security and data sovereignty within Political Liberalism articulating a bridge between the above blocs, while addressing health determinants integrally and globally: social determinants of health, political determinants of health, economic determinants of health, commercial determinants of health, and digital determinants of health. Specific advances include shared global governance, affordable clean energy transition, and affordable AI digital transformation for sustainable development (with deference and deterrence guardrails maximizing cooperation, managing strategic competition, and minimizing conflict). The chapter additionally considers medical diplomacy, multilateral development, deep medicine, large language models (including ChatGPT), commercial fusion, and digital supply chain resilience (with diversification and de-risking), in the context of moving away from an imperial ideological values-driven ruler-based world order to a more sovereign integral values-driven rules-based world order."

2024,The protection of vulnerable algorithmic groups through collective data protection in the onlife world: A Brazilian perspective,Diego Machado,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2024.106027,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364924000931,,,,"The aim of this doctrinal legal study is to analyze the interplay between the vulnerability of groups in algorithmic systems and the protection of collective interests in data protection law in Brazil's legal system. Two research questions are raised: (i) Is the protection of personal data regulation applicable to data processing activities related to algorithmic groups? and (ii) can algorithmic groups be regarded as groups with vulnerability under the LGPD legal regime? This article is divided into three parts apart from the introduction, and combines three strands of research, namely group rights theory, vulnerability studies, and law and technology perspective. This combination is key to outline, in Sections 2 and 3, a theoretical framework that elucidates the concepts of collective data protection and group vulnerability mapping both onto the notion of algorithmic groups. Section 2 argues for the collective dimension of the right to the protection of personal data as the foundation of a collective data protection. Section 3, in turn, explores the conceptualization of group vulnerability and how this discourse resonates with algorithmic groups in the onlife world. I draw on vulnerability studies, and on Mireille Hildebrandt's law and technology perspective to delineate what do I mean by group vulnerability and how do I articulate theoretically this notion with algorithmic groups and the affordances of algorithmic systems. Section 4 examines the relation between collective data protection and vulnerability of algorithmic groups under the data protection legal framework in Brazil. To answer the research questions, the analysis is concentrated on three aspects of Brazilian data protection law: (i) the “collectivization of data protection”; (ii) the integration of group vulnerability in the data protection legal framework; (iii) data protection impact assessments in the context of LGPD's risk-based approach. The collective dimension of the right to personal data protection is increasingly recognized in Brazilian law through class-action litigation, particularly in the context of addressing vulnerabilities caused by new data-driven technologies. This collective dimension should guide courts and the Brazilian DPA in interpreting and applying the LGPD, especially Art. 12, § 2, regarding group data processing by algorithmic profiling systems. Data protection law in Brazil acknowledges that groups of data subjects may face vulnerability, requiring special protection and safeguards to mitigate risks and violations. Group vulnerability signals contexts deserving special attention and serves as a source of obligations and rights. Within LGPD's risk-based approach, mandatory DPIAs in ML-based algorithmic profiling systems help identify vulnerable groups and implement appropriate safeguards to mitigate risks of harm or rights violations. Non-compliance with safeguard implementation obligations should be considered a breach of Brazilian data protection laws."
2016,Utilizing cumulative population distribution information in differential evolution,Yong Wang and Zhi-Zhong Liu and Jianbin Li and Han-Xiong Li and Gary G. Yen,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2016.07.012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494616303386,,,,"Differential evolution (DE) is one of the most popular paradigms of evolutionary algorithms. In general, DE does not exploit distribution information provided by the population and, as a result, its search performance is limited. In this paper, cumulative population distribution information of DE has been utilized to establish an Eigen coordinate system by making use of covariance matrix adaptation. The crossover operator of DE implemented in the Eigen coordinate system has the capability to identify the features of the fitness landscape. Furthermore, we propose a cumulative population distribution information based DE framework called CPI-DE. In CPI-DE, for each target vector, two trial vectors are generated based on both the original coordinate system and the Eigen coordinate system. Then, the target vector is compared with these two trial vectors and the best one will survive into the next generation. CPI-DE has been applied to two classic versions of DE and three state-of-the-art variants of DE for solving two sets of benchmark test functions, namely, 28 test functions with 30 and 50 dimensions at the 2013 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, and 30 test functions with 30 and 50 dimensions at the 2014 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation. The experimental results suggest that CPI-DE is an effective framework to enhance the performance of DE."
2015,Multi-population differential evolution with balanced ensemble of mutation strategies for large-scale global optimization,Mostafa Z. Ali and Noor H. Awad and Ponnuthurai N. Suganthan,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2015.04.019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494615002458,,,,"Differential evolution (DE) is a simple, yet very effective, population-based search technique. However, it is challenging to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation behaviors of the DE algorithm. In this paper, we boost the population diversity while preserving simplicity by introducing a multi-population DE to solve large-scale global optimization problems. In the proposed algorithm, called mDE-bES, the population is divided into independent subgroups, each with different mutation and update strategies. A novel mutation strategy that uses information from either the best individual or a randomly selected one is used to produce quality solutions to balance exploration and exploitation. Selection of individuals for some of the tested mutation strategies utilizes fitness-based ranks of these individuals. Function evaluations are divided into epochs. At the end of each epoch, individuals between the subgroups are exchanged to facilitate information exchange at a slow pace. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on a set of 19 large-scale continuous optimization problems. A comparative study is carried out with other state-of-the-art optimization techniques. The results show that mDE-bES has a competitive performance and scalability behavior compared to the contestant algorithms."
2019,A review of the ICT-enabled development literature: Towards a power parity theory of ICT4D,Wallace Chipidza and Dorothy Leidner,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsis.2019.01.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302391,,,,"ICT projects are considered an important means of achieving development goals in developing countries. Although voluminous, the research to date is inconsistent in theorizing how, or why, development outcomes do or do not occur following the introduction of ICT4D. To better understand how and why ICT projects succeed, and even what success means in the ICT4D context, we conducted a literature review of ICT4D studies published during the period 2000–2016. We find that the very meaning of development varies, with four meanings of development emerging from the literature: (1) development as increased freedom, (2) development as expanded inclusion, (3) development as increased economic productivity, and (4) development as improved well-being. An ICT might succeed according to one meaning of development while simultaneously hindering achievement according to another meaning. As revealed by our analysis of the literature, these four perspectives suffer from some limitations, not least among them being the imposition of colonialist views of development on the recipients of the ICT4D. To address the limitations, we employ postcolonial theory to derive a new theory of ICT4D in which development is defined as an increase in power parity between dominant stakeholders and intended beneficiaries."

Agent-based modeling is a powerful and versatile tool that allows us to simulate complex systems by representing individual agents and their interactions within a given environment. Here, we will take a step-by-step approach, starting with classic models and gradually moving toward creating customized versions. By understanding how these models work and learning how to modify and extend them, we will gain valuable insights into alternative scenarios and even uncover entirely new phenomena."

2025,Bridging cultural gaps in product design: A cross-cultural supervisor approach using large language model,Keyin Chen and Rui Yao and Zhichuan Tang and Anqi Yao and Xiaoneng Jin,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.daai.2025.100004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S3050741325000047,,,,"Cross-cultural design in the globalized marketplace faces the challenges of linguistic, geographical, and cultural complexity, which limits designers’ ability to create good cross-cultural product designs. This study proposes a “cross-cultural supervisor” approach based on the large language model (LLM) and the CO-STAR framework, which aims to enhance designers’ understanding of multiculturalism and optimize design concepts. By constructing a cross-cultural design metric system and quantifying cultural factors via the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), this method provides scientific support for the decision-making of cross-cultural design. We propose two main strategies: 1) optimizing cultural sensitivity and feeding back cultural knowledge in GPT-4 on the basis of the CO-STAR framework and 2) generating and evaluating design solutions via GPT-4. The effectiveness of this strategy was verified, showing that the cross-cultural supervisor approach significantly enhances cross-cultural design reports. This approach is particularly effective in design areas where cultural backgrounds and personal preferences strongly influence product outcomes. By offering insights into aesthetics, materials, and local traditions, it enables designers to adapt products to the unique cultural and behavioral expectations of diverse markets. In the era of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), this study presents a new methodology for cross-cultural product design, contributing valuable theoretical and practical insights."

O’Dell and Gordon Bowen and Daniel Hagan and Arshad Jamal,"This paper is an attempt to examine leadership in the digital era, which gives rise to digital leadership. Digital technology has caused a rethink of the leadership approach in a digital environment that is continuous, dynamic, proactive, and complex, which is driven by phenomena such as globalisation (connectiveness and integration), mass immigration, and multiculturalism. E-privacy requires consent from all parties; how to engage them in the process is a central theme of the paper. Furthermore the type of leadership required is discussed and how it needs to develop in the future, which is identified as the post-General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) era. Last, but not least, is a discussion of the challenges the e-privacy debate presents, such as collective or group e-privacy, and moving from a tick-box approach to GDPR to a recognised global framework that requires commitment from the CEO and the senior management team. Leverage via reputational damage and the power of a regulatory regime could be tools to make businesses commit in spirit to the GDPR framework and view it not just as a penalty for doing business."

The limitations and future research directions are presented."
2025,Challenges and opportunities: Implementing diversity and inclusion in software engineering university level education in Finland,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2024.112239,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121224002838,,,,"Considerable efforts have been made at the high school level to encourage girls to pursue software engineering careers and raise awareness about diversity within the field. Similarly, software companies have become more active in diversity and inclusion (D&I) topics, aiming to create more inclusive work environments. However, the way diversity and inclusion are approached inside software engineering university education remains less clear. This study investigates the current state of D&I in software engineering education and faculties in Finland. An online survey (N = 30) was conducted among Finnish software engineering university teachers to investigate which approaches and case examples of D&I are most commonly used by software engineering teachers in Finland. In addition, it was researched how software engineering teachers perceive the importance of D&I in their courses. As a result of the quantitative and thematic analysis, a framework to identify attitudes, approaches, challenges and pedagogical strategies when implementing D&I themes in software engineering education is presented. This framework also offers a process for integrating D&I themes for the curriculum or at the faculty level. The findings of this study emphasize that there is a continuing need for diverse-aware education and training. The results underline the responsibility of universities to ensure that future professionals are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to promote D&I in the field of software engineering."
2024,3 - Design part II: Artificial intelligence i(ntegral+) s(ustainable) development,Dominique J.

Monlezun,"This chapter considers integral sustainable development as the grand strategic vision of the global public health ecosystem. This follows the global consensus of the world’s countries on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) through the United Nations as its own strategy for world peace through equitable prosperity, subsequently embraced by the World Health Organization for measuring and advancing toward equitable health for all. This chapter begins with an historical overview of this development strategy following World War II through the Cold War to the present moment with the increasing introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) for social good generally, and AI advancing the SDGs specifically, or “AI × SDGs.” This ecosystem model is essentially a whole-of-world approach that bridges whole-of-government and whole-of-society movements to unite diverse sectors, stakeholders, and belief systems for the advancement of personal and population health at scale, ultimately to advance humanity’s health. This chapter features a detailed breakdown of concrete use cases of AI according to specific SDGs, including those in precision agriculture to reduce poverty and hunger, enhanced climate change prediction and mitigation, affordable clean energy transitions (with advances protecting biodiversity), and more equitable and decolonized global–local public–private partnerships (spanning mRNA vaccines and digital diagnostics, including lab-on-a-chip tests especially for low-income countries and remote areas). This chapter also considers such AI development advances for health in the global context of polycrises, which boost the risk of the Great Divergence becoming permanent—at least for the foreseeable future. This chapter considers how climate change, COVID-19, Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine (driving further global debt, food, and energy crises), worsening demographics (with the growing global burden of disease), and increasing regional conflicts raise the likelihood and duration of the growing separation of the Global South from the Global West and North, with their AI and digital technology–powered advanced economies. This chapter therefore considers how responsible AI may bridge this structural separation through the sustainable development strategy, without which the power and riches of the Global North are not just morally but also pragmatically undermined without more equitable global growth."

One of the main challenges in data anonymization is achieving a balance between ensuring data privacy and maintaining data utility. To address these challenges, recent studies have explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown improved performance on datasets from Europe. Based on these findings, this paper aims to create a dataset from less explored parts of the world, specifically Africa, to assess the relevance of LLMs on diverse datasets and to discuss the generalization of the results. Additionally, this paper proposes an evaluation framework for assessing various anonymization techniques, including those utilizing LLMs. The performance of these techniques is assessed using several metrics, such as BERTScore for semantic evaluation and Information Loss for utility preservation."
2023,Designing a Mobile e-Coaching App for Immigrant Informal Caregivers: Qualitative Study Using the Persuasive System Design Model,Shweta Premanandan and Awais Ahmad and Åsa Cajander and Pär Ågerfalk and Michal Dolezel and Lisette {van Gemert-Pijnen},https://doi.org/10.2196/50038,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2291522223000980,,,,"Background
Informal caregivers are vital in caring for their family and friends at home who may have illnesses or disabilities. In particular, the demands for caregiving can be even more challenging for those with limited resources, support systems, and language barriers, such as immigrant informal caregivers. They face complex challenges in providing care for their relatives. These challenges can be related to sociocultural diversity, language barriers, and health care system navigation. Acknowledging the global context of the increasing number of immigrants is essential in designing inclusive mobile health apps.
Objective
This study aims to investigate the needs of immigrant informal caregivers in Sweden and discuss the application of the Persuasive System Design Model (PSDM) to develop an e-coaching prototype. By addressing the unique challenges faced by immigrant informal caregivers, this study will contribute to the development of more effective and inclusive mobile health apps.
Methods
The participants were considered immigrants and included in the study if they and their parents were born outside of Sweden. Through various channels, such as the National Association of Relatives, rehabilitation departments at municipalities, and immigrant groups, we recruited 13 immigrant informal caregivers. These immigrant informal caregivers were primarily women aged 18 to 40 years. Most participants belonged to the Middle Eastern region whereas some were from North Africa. However, all of them spoke Arabic. We used semistructured interviews to gather data from the participants in Arabic, which were translated into English. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis and discussed in relation to the extended PSDM. The needs of the caregivers were compared with the description of persuasive design principles, and a design principle was chosen based on the match. The PSDM was extended if the need description did not match any principles. Several brainstorming and prototyping sessions were conducted to design the mobile e-coaching app.
Results
Immigrant informal caregivers have various needs in their caregiving role. They reported a need for training on the illness and future caregiving needs, assistance with understanding the Swedish language and culture, and help with accessing internet-based information and services. They also required recognition and appreciation for their efforts, additional informal support, and easy access to health care services, which can be important for their mental health. The PSDM was adapted to the informal caregiving context by adding “facilitating conditions” and “verbal encouragement” as additional persuasive design principles. This study also presents the subsequent mobile e-coaching app for immigrant informal caregivers in Sweden.
Conclusions
This study revealed important immigrant informal caregivers’ needs based on which design suggestions for a mobile e-coaching app were presented. We also proposed an adapted PSDM, for the informal caregiving context. The adapted PSDM can be further used to design digital interventions for caregiving."

Industry 5.0 poses new challenges in the area of people management, including those related to workforce skills required by employers and necessary in the near future in the efficient management of companies, their effective operation, and a competitive advantage in the market. The concept of Industry 5.0 requires companies and managers to change their attitude to employees. Their new modus operandi should cover new requirements regarding workforce skills and new ways of attracting and retaining human capital equipped with adequate skills. The aim of this article is to present workforce skills identified by managers from three European countries (Portugal, France, and Greece) as particularly important in Industry 5.0. The research methods used in the study are a literature review and 12 individual in-depth interviews conducted in 2023 (four interviewees from each country covered by the study). The analysis of literature and the interviews conducted by the author reveal that workforce skills in Era 5.0 are moving in the direction of soft skills and can be divided into four groups: problem-solving, working with people, technology use and development, and self-management. Workforce skills in Industry 5.0, especially those related to managing multicultural teams, is a research area which has not been extensively studied so far. Even though the study described in the article is only qualitative and conducted on a small sample, its results justify recommending further in-depth studies and can be used by companies to improve their search for employees who possess skills which correspond to the requirements of Industry 5.0."

2021,Predicting the Linguistic Accessibility of Chinese Health Translations: Machine Learning Algorithm Development,Meng Ji and Pierrette Bouillon,https://doi.org/10.2196/30588,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S229196942100034X,,,,"Background
Linguistic accessibility has an important impact on the reception and utilization of translated health resources among multicultural and multilingual populations. Linguistic understandability of health translation has been understudied.
Objective
Our study aimed to develop novel machine learning models for the study of the linguistic accessibility of health translations comparing Chinese translations of the World Health Organization health materials with original Chinese health resources developed by the Chinese health authorities.
Methods
Using natural language processing tools for the assessment of the readability of Chinese materials, we explored and compared the readability of Chinese health translations from the World Health Organization with original Chinese materials from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Results
A pairwise adjusted t test showed that the following 3 new machine learning models achieved statistically significant improvement over the baseline logistic regression in terms of area under the curve: C5.0 decision tree (95% CI –0.249 to –0.152; P<0.001), random forest (95% CI 0.139-0.239; P<0.001) and extreme gradient boosting tree (95% CI 0.099-0.193; P<0.001). There was, however, no significant difference between C5.0 decision tree and random forest (P=0.513). The extreme gradient boosting tree was the best model, achieving statistically significant improvement over the C5.0 model (P=0.003) and the random forest model (P=0.006) at an adjusted Bonferroni P value at 0.008.
Conclusions
The development of machine learning algorithms significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of current approaches to the evaluation of the linguistic accessibility of Chinese health information, especially Chinese health translations in relation to original health resources. Although the new algorithms developed were based on Chinese health resources, they can be adapted for other languages to advance current research in accessible health translation, communication, and promotion."

This study aims to enhance social inclusion by identifying the health information needs of African migrants in Spain and evaluating the resources provided by Spanish NGOs. Using a mixed-methods approach, including qualitative interviews and quantitative analysis, the findings reveal significant barriers to accessing health information, such as unfamiliarity with the healthcare system and cultural obstacles. NGOs play a crucial role in mediating access to information and healthcare services, employing strategies to overcome linguistic and cultural challenges. The research highlights the importance of adapting information access strategies to the specific needs of migrants and suggests that involving migrant communities and NGOs in the design of information systems is essential to ensuring equitable access. This approach is critical for preventing social exclusion and promoting better integration into society."

This paper aims to determine how to take advantage of the virtual communities of practice that employ Web 2.0 technologies to overcome the obstacles of KM. Employing the descriptive approach based on theoretical analysis of literature, the results revealed that Web 2.0 technologies involve important applications in personal KM, supporting participation in participatory KM, in addition to supporting communication and interaction mechanisms. Moreover, results indicated that Web 2.0-based-communities of practice play major roles in capturing tacit knowledge, facilitating innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and collaboration."

To create the curriculum, we ran a series of participatory design sessions with various educational stakeholders including students, teachers, administrators, and parents. In this article, we explore the ways that ideas from the participatory design sessions shaped the final curriculum. Specifically, we focus on the use of participatory design as a context for culturally relevant idea generation and the various ways these ideas can be incorporated into instructional materials. We present these methods of integration as potential means through which others seeking to create culturally relevant materials can utilize participatory design and stakeholder voices within their design process."

Among various factors that contribute to K-pop's global appeal, this study focuses on social media, particularly online video platforms. Video platforms are important as they enable artists to communicate directly with fans through live videos and encourage grassroots participation from fans. This study specifically focuses on a niche K-pop video platform, V Live, to investigate the factors that contribute to the artists' V Live channel success. By examining factors related to K-pop artists, the artist's V Live activities, and V Live support factors, the study examines 289 K-pop artists' V Live channels using hierarchical regression analysis. The study found that high popularity and fan engagement rates are influenced by K-pop artists' video uploads and the support from V Live and entertainment companies. As more celebrities and K-pop artists use online video platforms to communicate with fans, collaborative and strategic support is needed from not only artists and entertainment companies but also from platform operators to enhance K-pop's global reach."

2016,Augmented places: An impact of embodied historical experience on attitudes towards places,Tomasz Oleksy and Anna Wnuk,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.12.014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215302909,,,,"Aim
The purpose of this paper was to examine the possibility of using Augmented Reality to reduce memory-related ethnic bias towards places and to increase understanding of multicultural place meaning and change emotional attitudes towards historical sites.
Background
Theoretical and empirical works suggest that the direct, embodied contact with place's history facilitates understanding of its past. Places which were deprived of historical continuity are less liked and threatened by ethnic bias in collective memory. AR technology gives a possibility of recreating past of such places and in a consequence tests an influence of experience of place's history on psychological aspects of the people-place relationship.
Method
A between-subjects experiment was conducted, in which participants either walked with an AR application displaying historical photos in real environment or watched photos on computers. The chosen place was the former Jewish district in Warsaw, Poland.
Results
The results of multiple regression analyses showed that the AR application can facilitate positive attitudes towards a place, reduce ethnic bias and enhance multicultural place meaning.
Conclusions
We argue that AR could be used as a method of reviving (multi)cultural heritage, but also as a tool of reducing prejudices and increasing openness to other cultures and traditions."

Robinson,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2023.01.462,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705092300474X,,,,"Global project teams (GPTs) have emerged in the 21st century as the primary construct by which complex and often high-stakes changes of global scale are planned and delivered. Data from the field of GPT practice includes the recurrent observation that some GPT practitioners seem to thrive in the cross-cultural context of the GPT, while others flounder. This research paper explores how cultural diversity influences motivation and performance within the GPT. It extracts themes of interest from a detailed literature review and further explores them in the context of a field study of 79 GPT practitioners in 21 countries. CQ-motivation emerges as a potent predictor of motivation and performance in the GPT. The study concludes that GPT team selection processes which actively leverage CQ-motivation, project manager ownership, and the prioritisation of attitude over functional skills, will be supportive of superior GPT performance."
2025,Public value and digital health: The example of guiding values in the national digital health strategy of France,Simon Lewerenz and Anne Moen and Henrique Martins,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105794,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505625000115,,,,"Introduction
In the WHO European Region, 44 of 53 reporting Member States (MS) have a national digital health strategy (NDHS) or policy. Their formulation is heterogenous and evolving and should best reflect public common interest. This research aims to explore how a public value approach improves the relevance of digital health policies and services, increasing their capacity to better serve the diverse range of societal interests. It utilises the guiding values within the French NDHS as an example before discussing other digital health policies such as the European Heath Data Space.
Methods
Three homogenous focus group discussions were conducted in November and December 2023. Each focus group separately gathered distinct stakeholders: public clients, health professionals, private sector. 19 participants were included in the study. Data collection comprised live polling and semi-structured discussion. Results were analysed considering the pre-defined stakeholder groups and the values discussed during the study.
Results
Findings reveal both technical and cultural challenges in digital health that highlight the need for adaptable frameworks across different contexts. Stakeholder insights informed a framework classifying public values into democratic and managerial categories, suggesting themes that may be relevant to digital health strategies in other national and regional settings.
Discussion
Public value is discussed as a multidimensional concept, and the plurality of its perceptions give basis for tailored approaches to serve different value-beneficiaries comprehensively. We propose this values-based approach as a systematic model for supra-, sub-, and national scales and additional policy topics, beyond digital health strategies.
Conclusion
The study suggests that using a public value lens considering multiple perceptions is valuable for advancing digital health policy in a responsible and ethical manner. Such an approach could promote wider governance of and adoption of digital health. To evolve the framework, application in multiple and large ecosystems at different levels should be considered."

In this context, computer sciences combined with engineering processes constitutes a powerful way for companies to be able to improve process management, to interact with such markets in an efficient and effective way. The main objective of this article is to use Arena simulation software, to quantitatively predict the impact of improvements applied in metal surface treatment processes, based on tools to support Lean thinking. A case study in a Portuguese company in the metalworking sector is presented, in which it is verified that the proposed improvements in terms of the factory layout and resource management, suggested by the comparison between simulations of the current state of the company and the improved one, streamline the processes of finishing in metals, namely zinc coating and lacquering which prevent the occurrence of oxidation and the consequent corrosion of the base metals, by adding other metals and materials to their surface, which adhere and protect it. Through the results obtained, it is concluded that the reduction of waiting times and transport of stocks without production and of work-in-progress, as well as the increase of the productive capacity, make the company more able to guarantee the satisfaction of the requirements of its customers and improve its positioning in the market compared to its competitors."
2025,Deciphering Urban Soundscapes: A study of sensory experiences at Hong Kong Victoria harbour waterfronts using social media,Haotian Wang and Zidong Yu and Xintao Liu,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2025.102307,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971525000602,,,,"The impact of sensory experiences on physical and mental health in urban environments has gained significant attention, particularly the influence of soundscapes in waterfronts development. This study employed social media data from Twitter to quantitatively analyse the soundscape of Hong Kong Victoria Harbour waterfronts, offering a novel perspective in urban sensory research. Through comparative analysis between tourists and residents, it uncovered how different groups perceive soundscapes in these specific urban waterfronts setting. Utilizing a two-step analytical approach—initially applying rank-size distribution and mean difference index—this study mapped the spatial distribution of soundscapes and used global and local regression models to explore their correlations with key urban features such as building density, population density, and ethnic diversity. The findings revealed distinct spatial patterns in how soundscapes are experienced by tourists and residents at the Victoria Harbour waterfronts, influenced significantly by the built environment. For instance, while residents experience negative auditory sensory in high building density areas, tourists perceive these areas positively. Furthermore, this research underscored the differing correlations of population density on soundscape experience among these groups. Residents enjoy positive soundscape connections in bustling areas, whereas tourists prefer quieter environments. Moreover, the research also found the differences in how residents and tourists accept multicultural soundscapes. This study not only contributed theoretically by linking soundscapes to urban and socio-economic variables but also demonstrated the potential of social media data as a tool for studying urban sensory. The study findings could offer insights that are relevant to planning and design of urban waterfronts."

The aim of this study was to create the first open-source, three-dimensional statistical shape model of the mandible that spans the complete growth period. Computed tomography scans of 678 mandibles from children and young adults between 0 and 22 years old were included in the model. The mandibles were segmented using a semi-automatic or automatic (artificial intelligence-based) segmentation method. Point correspondence among the samples was achieved by rigid registration, followed by non-rigid registration of a symmetrical template onto each sample. The registration process was validated with adequate results. Principal component analysis was used to gain insight in the variation within the dataset and to investigate age-related changes and sexual dimorphism. The presented growth model is accessible globally and free-of-charge for scientists, physicians and forensic investigators for any kind of purpose deemed suitable. The versatility of the model opens up new possibilities in the fields of oral and maxillofacial surgery, forensic sciences or biological anthropology. In clinical settings, the model may aid diagnostic decision-making, treatment planning and treatment evaluation."
2025,A decade of gender bias in machine translation,Beatrice Savoldi and Jasmijn Bastings and Luisa Bentivogli and Eva Vanmassenhove,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2025.101257,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389925001059,,,,"Summary
Gender bias in machine translation (MT) has been studied for over a decade, a time marked by societal, linguistic, and technological shifts. With the early optimism for a quick solution in mind, we review over 100 studies on the topic and uncover a more complex reality—one that resists a simple technical fix. While we identify key trends and advancements, persistent gaps remain. We argue that there is no simple technical solution to bias. Building on insights from our review, we examine the growing prominence of large language models and discuss the challenges and opportunities they present in the context of gender bias and translation. By doing so, we hope to inspire future work in the field to break with past limitations and to be less focused on a technical fix; more user-centric, multilingual, and multiculturally diverse; more personalized; and better grounded in real-world needs."

The study conducted an analysis of 103,212 buzzes that had noted causes of cyberbullying and data were collected from 227 online channels, such as news websites, blogs, online groups, social network services, and online bulletin boards. Using opinion-mining method and decision tree analysis, the types of cyberbullying were sorted using SPSS 25.0. The results indicated that the total rate of types of cyberbullying in Korea was 44%, which consisted of 32.3% victims, 6.4% perpetrators, and 5.3% bystanders. According to the results, the impulse factor was also the greatest influence on the prediction of the risk factors and the propensity for dominance factor was the second greatest factor predicting the types of risk factors. In particular, the impulse factor had the most significant effect on bystanders, and the propensity for dominance factor was also significant in influencing online perpetrators. It is necessary to develop a program to diminish the impulses that were initiated by bystanders as well as victims and perpetrators because many of those bystanders have tended to aggravate impulsive cyberbullying behaviors."

Despite this, not all users are happy with the app; there are criticisms and suggestions, one of which is reviewed via the TikTok app on the Google Play Store. The reviews were extracted and then used for training a sentiment analysis model. The VADER sentiment method was utilized to offer the review's initial labeling (positive, neutral, and negative). The result revealed that most reviews were classified as positive, meaning that the data were imbalanced and challenging to handle in further analysis. Therefore, Random Under-sampling (RUS) and Random Over-sampling (ROS) methods were deployed to deal with that condition. The labeled reviews were subsequently pre-processed using tools such as case folding, noise removal, normalization, and stopwords before being used for training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for sentiment classification. The SVM trained without resampling produced the most favorable results, with an F1-score of 0.80."

It would be also worth analyzing which countries and authors have been mainly contributing to the topic, and what publication types are mostly used to convey research in that area. Even though there are numerous literature reviews regarding project communication issues and different aspects of virtual teams, there is no one dedicated specifically to the topic of communication in virtual project teams. Aim – the paper aims to identify the scientific output in the area of communication in virtual project teams from the last 20 years (2001-2020) and analyze it for its volume, geographic distribution, publication types, areas and types of research and contributing authors. Method – a bibliometric approach has been applied to answer the research questions regarding the number of publications in the studied period, most contributing countries and most prolific authors, prevailing publication types and research topics addressed in the studied literature. Three databases – Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were used to search for publications about communication in virtual project teams and the refined results from these databases were combined into the final dataset which was then analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. Contribution – the results of the bibliometric review of research on communication in virtual teams show that the most frequently undertaken topics concern methods and tools for communication in virtual teams, while issues linking communication with trust or leadership are the least explored areas."
2020,Vulnerable community identification using hate speech detection on social media,Zewdie Mossie and Jenq-Haur Wang,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102087,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457318310902,,,,"With the rapid development in mobile computing and Web technologies, online hate speech has been increasingly spread in social network platforms since it's easy to post any opinions. Previous studies confirm that exposure to online hate speech has serious offline consequences to historically deprived communities. Thus, research on automated hate speech detection has attracted much attention. However, the role of social networks in identifying hate-related vulnerable community is not well investigated. Hate speech can affect all population groups, but some are more vulnerable to its impact than others. For example, for ethnic groups whose languages have few computational resources, it is a challenge to automatically collect and process online texts, not to mention automatic hate speech detection on social media. In this paper, we propose a hate speech detection approach to identify hatred against vulnerable minority groups on social media. Firstly, in Spark distributed processing framework, posts are automatically collected and pre-processed, and features are extracted using word n-grams and word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec. Secondly, deep learning algorithms for classification such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a variety of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are used for hate speech detection. Finally, hate words are clustered with methods such as Word2Vec to predict the potential target ethnic group for hatred. In our experiments, we use Amharic language in Ethiopia as an example. Since there was no publicly available dataset for Amharic texts, we crawled Facebook pages to prepare the corpus. Since data annotation could be biased by culture, we recruit annotators from different cultural backgrounds and achieved better inter-annotator agreement. In our experimental results, feature extraction using word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec performs better in both classical and deep learning-based classification algorithms for hate speech detection, among which GRU achieves the best result. Our proposed approach can successfully identify the Tigre ethnic group as the highly vulnerable community in terms of hatred compared with Amhara and Oromo. As a result, hatred vulnerable group identification is vital to protect them by applying automatic hate speech detection model to remove contents that aggravate psychological harm and physical conflicts. This can also encourage the way towards the development of policies, strategies, and tools to empower and protect vulnerable communities."

Based on a comprehensive literature review, 34 traditional project management techniques were surveyed. The online questionnaire survey was distributed to 100 construction project management professionals, obtaining 38% response rate. The findings highlighted the most used traditional project management practices, such as kick-off meeting, teamwork, progress meetings, and reports. In contrast, the adoption of newer techniques, like earned value and statistical control charts, was found to be limited employed. While traditional project management techniques remain essential due to the linear nature of workflows in construction, the study suggests that there may be opportunities to integrate newer approaches that emphasize monitoring, analysis, and risk management more effectively. Further research on leading companies was recommended to develop strategies for managing increasing project complexity in the construction sector."

Monlezun,"This chapter introduces the book’s unique value proposition as the first comprehensive global analysis of how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming modern health generally—and how it specifically can revolutionize the decolonized global public health ecosystem to equitably empower the world to solve our era’s defining challenges undermining the health of humanity, from climate change to conflicts, debt crises to deglobalization, and demographic collapse to arrested development. In addition, this chapter outlines the historical evolution, from public health’s early days focused on premodern quarantines to the 19th century’s early modern vaccines and workplace safety, to the 20th century’s late modern globalization following World War II, and 21st-century global public health as data-driven sustainable development, digitalized and institutionalized by the United Nations, World Health Organization, and related public–private partnerships. This chapter considers the anticolonial and COVID-19 critiques of this process and the current global public health ecosystem, setting the stage for the “Great COVID Reset” to foster a human security–based approach to scale responsible AI globally by respecting diverse identities, agency, and values, locally. This chapter introduces this approach, the Personalist Liberalism, as the person-centered, health-based political economic framework to understand the emergent future of health in the context of our world’s structural power imbalances between peoples, elites, institutions, corporations, and governments. It summarizes these themes and trends amid the emerging primary categories for AI use cases illustrating them, including population health, precision public health, and system optimization, to set the stage for the remainder of the book focusing on the ecosystem’s main constitutive domains. Finally, this chapter outlines the structure of the book—focused on responsible AI reengineering a global public health ecosystem as a common home for all humanity—with these domains as the components of a home: design (financing and integral development), framework (data architecture and political economics), inhabitants (culture and demographics), and foundation (security and ethics)."

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as game-changers across industries, revolutionizing various sectors by harnessing extensive text data to analyze and generate human-like text. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs often encounter challenges when dealing with domain-specific queries, potentially leading to inaccuracies in their outputs. In response, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a viable solution. By seamlessly integrating external data retrieval into text generation processes, RAG aims to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the generated content. However, existing literature reviews tend to focus primarily on the technological advancements of RAG, overlooking a comprehensive exploration of its applications. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a thorough review of RAG applications, encompassing both task-specific and discipline-specific studies, while also outlining potential avenues for future research. By shedding light on current RAG research and outlining future directions, this review aims to catalyze further exploration and development in this dynamic field, thereby contributing to ongoing digital transformation efforts."

The opportunities for prosperity and sustainable development offered by Electronic Payment Systems (EPS) are of great interest to both authorities and various stakeholders, especially in developing countries. Needless to say, UTAUT2 explains only 40 % of the actual use's variance. This model lacks certain salient constructs that have proven to be relevant. Based on 41 reviewed articles, this current paper aims to provide an innovative model built on robust theoretical foundations, including two new concepts Contextual Acquaintance that encompasses experience, familiarity, and situational normality, and Overall Reliability which gathers consistency of the technology itself and stakeholders’ reliability. This led us to uncover new endogenous mechanisms without burdening the model with multiple variables. Furthermore, this model incorporates for the first time horizontal and vertical dimensions of collectivism and individualism in the context of EPS adoption, providing a more profound understanding of behaviors in multicultural societies. Finally, this paper provides a research framework for scholars to reduce the redundancies observed in this context."

Until the last twenty years, young people have traditionally met their information needs through reading. It was formed as a result of long historical traditions. There has always been a significant difference between ""heard information"" and ""read information"". The percentage of ""read information"" by young people with higher education should have been higher than the percentage of ""listened to information"". This percentage determined the intelligence of the young man and expressed his social and cultural qualities. Surveys show that young people spend ""time reading"" on the Internet and are content with getting ""episodic"" information instead of classical reading. Also, reading is not one of the main activities in the organization of leisure. Here, too, the main place is occupied by the Internet. Over the past twenty years, the “time” spent on the Internet has been growing dynamically and is crowding out various traditional activities for young people. Students of the Azerbaijan State University of Culture and Arts created a working group to study the classical reading skills of young people, conducted surveys and obtained interesting results. To study the classic reading habits of young people belonging to different categories, and to compare the results obtained, it is necessary to have certain standards and norms. Unfortunately, although the results are not comparable with other regions, in a country with a population of ten million and 54 universities, the attitude of young people towards classical reading reveals a certain pattern."

Participants were recruited from different cities in Saskatchewan, Canada. Data from in-depth interviews were triangulated with information gathered through field observations and a review of media reports. Data were analyzed manually by the researcher and patient partners on this project. Multiple steps were followed to analyze data inductively and iteratively. Data analysis involved isolation of codes, comparison and validation of codes, identification of categories specifying both positive and negative effects of COVID-19, and derivation of the broad themes reflecting the effects of COVID-19 on breastfeeding practices of immigrant mothers. Interpretations drawn from the data were verified with the study participants. The findings suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic has both positive and negative effects on the breastfeeding practices of immigrant women who are mothering. Key themes derived from the findings include quality time with an infant, lack of support and isolation, limited healthcare access and lactation counselling, mother-baby separation, healthcare restrictions and financial instability. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to promote, protect and support breastfeeding of immigrant women facing add-on challenges due to limited social support, isolation, and financial instability in a new country. This study provides unique insight that can make a difference moving forward by highlighting the adjustments that need to be made in healthcare practices for immigrant women to have a more positive breastfeeding experience in a future pandemic."

However, English education in China is still in the early stages of intelligence, and the current educational resources lack uniformity, teaching methods are single, and the standards for measuring educational quality also need to be improved. Therefore, this article studies the intelligent recommendation system for English teaching course videos based on machine learning. Firstly, the relevant theories of machine learning were analyzed, and the multiple linear regression, recurrent neural network algorithms, and logistic regression models in machine learning technology were analyzed. At the same time, Markov decision processes are also used to reinforce machine learning algorithms. Secondly, an English teaching video recommendation platform was established to analyze the regional preference and style preference in the field of video recommendation. Finally, an English course recommendation system was developed through the video recommendation technology of machine learning and the current situation of English teaching courses, which can promote the innovation and application of English teaching models."

However, different type of barriers existed that could affect collaboration in today’s work environment, in which different generations are involved. Although researchers have identified several technical barriers to intergenerational collaboration (iGOAL), the influence of cultural diversity on iGOAL has rarely been studied. Therefore, using a quantitative study approach, this paper investigates the impact of differences in cultural background on perceived technical and operational barriers to iGOAL. Our study reveals six barriers to IGC that are perceived differently by culturally diverse people (CDP) and non-CDP. Furthermore, CDP can foster IGC because CDP consider the barriers to be of less of a reason to avoid working with different generations than do non-CDP."

In recent years, some pioneering works have shown that users’ intrinsic characteristics, such as personality traits, can help improve the performance of recommender systems. However, they generally do not consider how to obtain users’ personality traits effectively without burdensome surveys and, therefore, cannot be used in new application domains without adequate personality information. Therefore, we propose a novel framework for building cross-domain personality-based recommender systems, especially for personality-scarce target domains. Specifically, we define the cross-domain personality trait classification problem and solve it in a semisupervised manner by leveraging the predictive text embedding method as the method for transfer learning from the source to the target domain. We then design a personality-boosted probabilistic matrix factorization method for personality-based recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that users’ personality traits can be recognized more precisely with cross-domain transfer learning, and recommendation performance is improved accordingly."

Research suggests that extremists use social media for reaching their purposes like recruitment, fund raising, and propaganda. Limited research is available to identify rebel users on social media platforms. Therefore, we propose a Supervised Rebel Identification (SRI) framework to identify rebels on Twitter. The framework consists of a novel mechanism to structure the users’ tweets into a directed user graph. This user graph links predicates (verbs) with the subject and object words to understand semantics of the underlying data. We convert the user graph into graph embedding to use these semantics within the machine learning algorithms. Apart from the user graph and its embedding, we propose fourteen other features belonging to tweets’ contents and users’ profiles. For evaluation, we present the first multicultural and multiregional dataset of rebels affiliated with nine rebel movements belonging to five countries. We evaluate the proposed SRI framework against two state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that the SRI framework outperforms the baselines with high accuracy."

Sometimes, which is becoming more common as time passes, the agglomeration of cultures at the point called city is not a celebratory moment. It comes with social stiffness among aboriginals, co-migrants and immigrants. Also, the aspirations dissolve in unsustainable physical conditions of living in the mega habitats of developing and underdeveloped countries.

Project managers must be aware of these factors and create an environment that fosters effective collaboration and trust. Tuckman’s model for group development consists of five stages: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. A lack of trust among team members can prevent a team from becoming a high-performance team. Research has shown a correlation between high-performance teams and GLOBE’s cultural dimensions. GLOBE, short for ""Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness,"" is a large-scale research program that explores cultural variations in leadership and organizational behavior. The cultural context and its impact on team dynamics can help organizations create more effective and high-performing teams. Trust is a key component of team performance and can lead to improved communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. In the oil and gas sector, multidisciplinary projects often involve complex engineering and technical challenges, so it is essential to have a team that is skilled, experienced, and focused on project success. The goal of this research is to investigate the influence of cultural dimensions and social behavior on project team success and to explore the role of trust in fostering effective collaboration and creating a high-performance team. The research approach employed in this study was secondary data analysis, utilizing existing data to address the research questions. This study found that cultural dimensions and social behavior significantly influence project team success. Trust plays a key role, and Tuckman’s model highlights its importance for high-performance teams. Overall, the results of this study provide insights and guidance for organizations to navigate cultural diversity, build trust, and enhance team performance. Implementing these findings can lead to improved project outcomes, stronger collaboration, and increased organizational effectiveness in various industries and sectors. However, a systematic review of recent literature on cultural diversity and global team performance is lacking, which highlights the need for further research in this area."

They should be able to manage successfully changing requirements, budget constraints and multicultural teams across several countries. Due to Covid19 pandemic context, digital skills have become even more important in order to manage remote teams and to handle increasingly complex projects. In this paper, we've conducted a systematic literature review so as to explore the main digital skills which enhance project managers’ efficiency. By analyzing the main extracted concepts from the papers resulting from our systematic literature review, we've concluded that adopting digital skills is as important as technical classic project management skills and soft skills. Also, we've performed a quantitative assessment of the 15 selected articles by using bibliometric tools. Indeed, our clustering analysis on the selected papers confirms the rise of digitals skills importance since the Covid19 pandemic. In light of the above, we believe that adopting and mastering digital skills is a requirement for current project managers in order to succeed in a changing and volatile environment. Digital skills will undoubtedly play a central role for project managers to stand out and thrive in this new normal."

In particular, consensus helps and polarization of opinions hinders cohesive teamwork. Existing approaches for modeling opinion dynamics mostly do not take into account the dynamism of social relations in a group. This paper proposes an algorithm and a program based on it, which allows modeling opinion dynamics considering that the strength of the connection, i.e. the probability of the next contact between two given group members depends on the result of their current communication. As an example, the paper presents the dynamics of opinions and the corresponding dynamics of the strength of bonds for a group of 100 people. With an initial uniform distribution of opinion values, over 50 cycles of interaction the group arrives at an equilibrium state with three subgroups that have opinion values as far apart as possible. The graphs of link dynamics show the formation of stable subgroups as early as after 5 cycles of interaction. The applicability of this model approach to a number of areas of applied and fundamental research is discussed."

Recently, a new type of domestic travel has emerged, namely domestic overseas-like travel experiences. These experiences are attractive to travellers who have a preference for exotic locations but no desire to travel internationally. Existing travel recommendation systems were not designed for such applications, nor do they have the relevant ability to recommend domestic overseas-like travel experiences to support travel decision making. To address this challenge, this paper focuses on the development of a recommendation model based on the visual content of photos for domestic overseas-like travel experiences and a prototype application. The application uses the latest advancement in computer vision — the concept model — to learn high-level concepts in an overseas travel destination photo collection to identify similar domestic travel experiences. We demonstrate the usability of the prototype application with a large-scale data set of approximately 479,000 travel photos taken in several countries and evaluate its utility and efficacy through four focus groups with target users."

Additionally, this study introduces fresh criteria and evaluation benchmarks for assessing lip synchronization in unconstrained videos. LipChanger demonstrates improved PSNR values, indicative of enhanced image quality. Furthermore, it exhibits highly accurate lip synthesis, as evidenced by lower LMD values and higher SSIM values. These outcomes suggest that the LipChanger approach holds significant potential for enhancing lip synchronization in talking face videos, resulting in more realistic lip movements. The proposed LipChanger model and its associated evaluation benchmarks show promise and could potentially contribute to advancements in lip-sync technology for unconstrained talking face videos."

In this article, we explore the current research on influencing factors in live-streaming, to identify the state of the field and inform future research. A scoping review was conducted to map the currently researched topics and factors, to find emerging or understudied topics, and to analyze the state of multidisciplinary and multicultural cooperation. Two iterations of a literature search and a citation-based literature mapping were used to collect 348 peer-reviewed entries. Identified and classified themes were analyzed along with visualizations of the local citation network, concept co-occurrence, and an inter-country citation graph. As a result, the main actors, genres, and issues in live-streaming, the frequency with which they are researched, and their trends over time were identified and described. Games and esports dominate research; topics recently gaining interest are e-commerce, mental health, collaboration and teaching using streams, and promoting tourism using streams. The body of literature is well connected; scientific disciplines and research groups seem to be aware of each other.

Groups included students from the three major Israeli education sectors—religious Jews, secular Jews, and Muslims—who completed pretest and posttest prejudice measures. Two sets of control subjects who did not participate in virtual groups provided comparative data. An interaction of the virtual groups experience×religious/cultural membership affected prejudice toward different religious/cultural target groups, by reducing prejudice toward the respective outgroups for whom the greatest initial enmity existed. Comparisons of virtual group participants to control subjects further support the influence of the online experience. Correlations between prejudice with group identification and with interpersonal measures differentiate which theoretical processes pertained."

Product images, a vital aspect of the system interface, play a significant role in shaping users' first impressions, facilitating seller-buyer information interaction, and ultimately enhancing users' decisions making in the system. Across a series of studies, this research investigates the effect of cultural differences (thinking style: holistic vs. analytic) on image background and reveals the underlying mechanism. Results show that online consumers from cultures characterized by holistic thinking style (Chinese sample) are more prone to purchase products presented with contextual backgrounds than those with white backgrounds, while this effect is absent for online consumers from cultures that tend to think in an analytic way (American sample). This effect is also observed when the thinking style is primed within the culture in separate samples from the United States and China. Study 3 employs eye-tracking technology and shows that holistic thinking, compared to analytic thinking, results in an asymmetry in cognitive effort to purchase the same products framed with contextual and white background images. Specifically, contextual (vs. white) background information greatly assists holistic thinking consumers in understanding the product, enabling them to spend less cognitive effort on product information processing. Instead, the cognitive effort that analytic thinking consumers spare in the product information is not affected by the background. Finally, we discuss theoretical contributions and practical insights for CBEC retailers and system designers that the findings indicate."

Some elements, many based on technologies, can be considered disruptive, but they have not had sufficient effect to produce a change in the model that has predominated for 300 years. In 2008, teachers began to offer training outside the walls of the university, with a totally disruptive and chaotic model compared to the traditional one; this was supported by open, informal, cooperative, connectivist, autonomous and self-guided training. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) began with cMOOCs, and most universities join the initiative, but they abandoned this disruption, ultimately offering the same courses they always had with free access for anyone, resulting in the second generation of MOOCs (xMOOCs). These MOOCs responded to a new social demand, but their characteristics and context make a formative disruption – which has not yet emerged – necessary. This paper analyses the elements of the two generations of MOOCs in order to propose a new model that does not require sophisticated technological solutions and recovers the initial disruptive sense of MOOCs, so called ahMOOC. It also presents a case study that integrates the social advantages of cMOOCs, the organisational benefits of xMOOCs and the personalisation of the learning, which is essential due to the heterogeneity of the participants. The results and the participant viewpoints emerging from the case study confirm the feasibility of the model, the improvement of the results of current MOOCs and the need – demanded by the participants – to consider diversity, all of which should be accomplished in a disruptive way."

To this end, this study integrates natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis technologies to propose innovative solutions: by constructing a multilingual text corpus covering news, social media, literature and other genres, it can completely restore the characteristics of global language use; The deep learning model is used to train the corpus to achieve accurate recognition of multilingual emotional tendencies, metaphorical expressions and culturally specific vocabulary. On this basis, automatic translation and content adjustment tools are developed, and on the premise of retaining the semantics of the original text, the symbol replacement (avoiding negative associations) and tone adaptation (conforming to local expression habits) are fine-tuned for the target culture. After field testing in multicultural areas and a large number of feedback data collection, the results showed that the acceptance of the optimized cross-cultural content in the target culture was significantly improved—the positive emotional feedback rate increased by 32 % on average, and the cultural misreading rate decreased by 19 %. This empirical evidence fully validates the great potential of NLP and sentiment analysis technology in enhancing the adaptability of cross-cultural communication."

Monlezun,"This chapter discusses the artificial intelligence (AI) ethics of the digital transformation of the global public health ecosystem from the perspectives of demographic, multicultural, and security shifts internationally. It considers global population aging with the consensus projections of demographic decline and even collapse in multiple regions of the Global North (especially in China, Japan, South Korea, and Europe) along with the demographic surge in the Global South (especially in Africa), and how these trends are accompanied by the accelerated health and financial burden of noncommunicable diseases, disproportionately straining low-income countries with decreasing resources from the aging North to assist. It additionally considers how 20th-century decolonization increasingly gave way to early 21st-century development and finally to 2010s–2020s and onward emphasis on multicultural diversity and biodiversity. This most recent phase seeks to advance equity and sovereignty along with global health to consider traditionally underrepresented voices in the ethics and values underlying governance in global public health. Finally, this chapter considers the growing importance of human security to bound national security concerns. This chapter therefore considers the centrality of this approach within Personalist Social Contract ethics, embedded in Political Liberalism political economics—beyond the overly simplified distinction of democracies versus autocracies—before applying it to concrete challenges and emergent solutions in the AI ethics of the global public health ecosystem. The challenges include the risks of AI including global inequities, technical weaponization, political destabilization (through social media misinformation), economic centralization, societal enfeeblement, and superintelligence (with up to existential risks for humanity). It also considers the challenges of generating and enforcing robust and sustainable consensus-based AI ethics for health amid superficial principle proliferation. This chapter outlines early responses including with the World Health Organization AI ethical principles, and then uses the Personalist Social Contract to show further advances (including in foundational work in AI existentialism) and real-time application (including defending global consensus on human dignity, rights, and sovereignty as in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, facilitating moral interoperability across the diverse sectors, states, and belief systems constituting the global public health ecosystem). Finally, this chapter illustrates the above in dialogue with African Ubuntu and global embodiment in the global village of our common home."

These benefits are best achieved when diverse groups are engaged in meaningful interactions through formal and informal activities. While measuring student diversity by analyzing the proportions of students of different nationalities and ethnic backgrounds in the enrollment statistics is easily done, examining whether these diverse groups interact outside of compulsory activities in the classroom is significantly more challenging. The purpose of this research is to apply social network analysis to map students' social activities. Using large-scale data on students' participation in social events at a major public university, we illustrate how to use social network analysis to visualize the social fabric of the student body as a whole and to explore the interwoven and isolated social clusters at the core and the periphery of students’ extracurricular activities. We explain how such findings can be used to inform university policies aimed at increasing social inclusion."

As a value-laden artefact, information technology (IT), such an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, is likely to introduce a counterculture in conflict with the implementing organization. Yet, how cultural alignment between IT and the implementing organization develops over time in a multicultural context is unknown. This research presents a dynamic process of cultural alignment, outlining the steps and events that lead to the alignment of cultural issues between an ERP system and the adopting organization at national, sectoral, organizational and group levels. Drawing on a longitudinal case study of a logistics service provider’s ERP system deployment across France, Italy, Morocco and Tunisia, this study shows that cultural alignment involves four key steps – requirement analysis, ERP selection, cultural misfit resolution and user testing – that are strongly influenced by technical, operational and organizational constraints. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the dynamic and intricate nature of the cultural alignment process, involving both the organization and technology."

A virtual learning environment (VLE) was used to link teachers and students of 5 schools in disadvantaged context of Chile through collaborative learning. The research is interpretive and positivist based on qualitative method approach, with quantitative contributions. Results show that talents of the students contribute to the formation of cultural identity that gives uniqueness to the human group to which they belong and the perception of teachers is that the phenomena of acculturation, enculturation and transculturation processes occur in learning linked to the management of the talents of students in intercultural contexts. With respect to the proposed model, trends indicate that it is possible to diagnose and promote talent through collaborative learning and intercultural dialogue. As for technology, it could be argued that it has reshaped relations between different cultures."

We measure value alignment by simulating sociological surveys and comparing the distribution of preferences from model responses to human references. We introduce a diversity-enhancement framework featuring a novel memory simulation mechanism, which enables the generation of model preference distributions and captures the diversity and uncertainty inherent in LLM behaviors through realistic survey experiments. To better understand the causes of misalignment, we have developed comprehensive evaluation metrics. Our analysis of multilingual survey data illustrates that our framework improves the reliability of cultural value alignment assessments and captures the complexity of model responses across cultural contexts.

The application of GIS is demonstrated using the results of the 2004 federal election. A Web-accessed GIS-enabled database to map the patterns of voter support for political parties at the local level of polling booths is developed. The socioeconomic factors which explain the variations across the polling booths in levels of support for all political parties in the nation’s federal electorates are identified. A statistical model is used to predict the different spatial patterns of political party’s voting dominance. Finally, GIS tools are used to map those places across Australia that are the heartlands of voter support for the Coalition parties and for the Labor Party and to identify those local areas which are highly marginal where the gap between the primary vote for the government and the opposition is small."

Particularly, the use of Spanish SNS has rarely been investigated. To shed light on this research direction, the current study compared the effects of using Spanish and English SNS on individuals' cultural orientations and attitude formation. A total of 113 adult consumers participated in a laboratory experiment where they were asked to evaluate either of two experimental websites, one with Hispanic cultural connotations and the other with American cultural meanings. Their SNS usage and cultural orientations were measured. It was found that more frequent usage of Spanish SNS was significantly associated with a higher level of Hispanic cultural orientation and a more favorable attitude toward the website with American cultural meanings. However, the use of English SNS did not significantly influence people's American cultural orientations and their website evaluations. Usage of both Spanish and English SNS was found to be motivated by individuals' social play dependency on such media platforms."

2020,Midwives’ Attitudes Toward and Experience With a Tablet Intervention to Promote Safety Behaviors for Pregnant Women Reporting Intimate Partner Violence: Qualitative Study,Lisa Garnweidner-Holme and Lena Henriksen and Eva Marie Flaathen and Tone {Klette Bøhler} and Mirjam Lukasse,https://doi.org/10.2196/16828,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2291522220003484,,,,"Background
Violence against women is considered a global health problem, and intimate partner violence (IPV) around the time of childbirth can have severe consequences for mother and child. Prenatal care is considered a window of opportunity to address IPV and ask women about exposure to violence since women are in regular contact with health care providers. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions might overcome the barriers to talking about IPV face-to-face.
Objective
Our objective was to explore midwives’ attitudes toward a tablet intervention consisting of information about IPV and safety behaviors as well as their experiences with recruiting pregnant women of different ethnic backgrounds in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
Methods
Individual interviews were conducted with 9 midwives who recruited participants for an RCT to test a video to promote safety behaviors delivered on a tablet during prenatal care. Analysis was guided by thematic analysis.
Results
Midwives perceived the tablet intervention as an appropriate supplement during prenatal care to provide information about IPV and promote safety behaviors. They participated in the RCT primarily to obtain more knowledge regarding how to communicate about IPV. The intervention was perceived as an anonymous door-opener to talk about IPV and a good solution to ensure that every woman gets the same information. However, the content of the intervention had to be trustworthy and align with the information the midwives provide to women. Given the sensitivity of IPV, midwives outlined the importance of following the intervention with face-to-face communication. Midwives reported technical problems and a high demand on their time as the main challenges to recruiting women. They experienced challenges recruiting women of different ethnic backgrounds due to linguistic barriers and the women’s skepticism about scientific research.
Conclusions
The tablet intervention might help midwives communicate about IPV. Although the video was considered as an anonymous door-opener to talk about IPV, midwives outlined the importance of following the intervention with face-to-face communication. The scarcity of midwives’ time during consultations has to be considered when implementing the intervention. Further research is needed to overcome barriers that limit inclusion of women from different ethnic backgrounds.

This study aims to propose a social-emotional competencies model for becoming a standard practice in healthcare units. Based on focus groups a customized set of indicators selected from the Social and emotional learning-SEL model and a multi-methods approach for assessing socioemotional competencies were proposed. An implementation diagram was also suggested. Information and communication technologies are essential for their implementation at the level of managing the generated information and in the development of computer troubleshooting scenarios for assessing competencies."

These new platforms have ushered in a new age of user-generated content, online chats, social network and comprehensive data on individual behavior. However, the abuse of communication software such as social media websites, online communities, and chats has resulted in a new kind of online hostility and aggressive actions. Due to widespread use of the social networking platforms and technological gadgets, conventional bullying has migrated from physical form to online, where it is termed as Cyberbullying. However, recently the digital technologies as machine learning and deep learning have been showing their efficiency in identifying linguistic patterns used by cyberbullies and cyberbullying detection problem. In this research paper, we aimed to evaluate shallow machine learning and deep learning methods in cyberbullying detection problem.

The field of child-computer interaction has long paid attention to DEI issues, but primarily from the perspective of empowering children to have voices in design or in the inclusion of children with disabilities; far less emphasis has been placed on issues of racial bias or systemic oppression. However, as more researchers heed the call to examine racial DEI in design contexts, others voice concerns that such an emphasis is a political issue that we should not focus on. In this paper, I take the former position, addressing this argument from the perspective of a Latina immigrant who grew up in Black, Brown, and immigrant spaces and attended low-income schools with a majority Black/Brown population. I do so to help my colleagues, especially those outside the United States, understand why racial DEI is critical in fields responsible for designing for children and empowering the next generation of design innovators. Towards this aim, I provide an accounting of the lived experiences of children of color in educational spaces and the harm they experience every day in formal and informal learning spaces. I then close the paper by providing six principles for the creation of child-centered empowerment in technological design spaces that we can use to mitigate many of the issues I raise."

The retention rate is positively and negatively influenced by factors belonging to several dimensions (personal, environmental, and institutional). We aim to use information from those dimensions to identify students enrolled in a Computer Networks course at risk of failing the subject. Besides, this needs to happen as early as possible, to be able to provide the students, for example, with extra support or resources to try to prevent that negative outcome. For predicting the grade level on the first test, the best accuracy obtained was 55%. However, most C-level grades were correctly classified, with 63% accuracy in predicting the students that are most at risk of failing, which is one of our main objectives. As for the prediction of the second test’s grade level, the best accuracy obtained was 89% and concerned data regarding the students’ interaction with the LMS together with students’ grades history. All the C-level grades were correctly classified (100% accuracy) and so we were able to correctly predict every student at a high risk of failing. Using the procedure described in this paper, we are able to anticipate the students needing extra support, and provide them with different resources, to try to prevent their negative outcome."

2022,A Participatory Design Approach to Develop Visualization of Wearable Actigraphy Data for Health Care Professionals: Case Study in Qatar,Kamran Khowaja and Wafa Waheeda Syed and Meghna Singh and Shahrad Taheri and Odette Chagoury and Dena Al-Thani and Michaël Aupetit,https://doi.org/10.2196/25880,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2292949522001018,,,,"Background
Several tools have been developed for health care professionals to monitor the physical activity of their patients, but most of these tools have been considering only the needs of users in North American and European countries and applicable for only specific analytic tasks. To our knowledge, no research study has utilized the participatory design (PD) approach in the Middle East region to develop such tools, involving all the stakeholders in the product development phases, and no clear use cases have been derived from such studies that could serve future development in the field.
Objective
This study aims to develop an interactive visualization tool (ActiVis) to support local health care professionals in monitoring the physical activity of their patients measured through wearable sensors, with the overall objective of improving the health of the Qatari population.
Methods
We used PD and user-centered design methodologies to develop ActiVis, including persona development, brainwriting, and heuristic walkthrough as part of user evaluation workshops; and use cases, heuristic walkthrough, interface walkthrough, and survey as part of expert evaluation sessions.
Results
We derived and validated 6 data analysis use cases targeted at specific health care professionals from a collaborative design workshop and an expert user study. These use cases led to improving the design of the ActiVis tool to support the monitoring of patients’ physical activity by nurses and family doctors. The ActiVis research prototype (RP) compared favorably with the Fitbit Dashboard, showing the importance of design tools specific to end users’ needs rather than relying on repurposing existing tools designed for other types of users. The use cases we derived happen to be culturally agnostic, despite our assumption that the local Muslim and Arabic culture could impact the design of such visualization tools. At last, taking a step back, we reflect on running collaborative design sessions in a multicultural environment and oil-based economy.
Conclusions
Beyond the development of the ActiVis tool, this study can serve other visualization and human–computer interaction designers in the region to prepare their design projects and encourage health care professionals to engage with designers and engineers to improve the tools they use for supporting their daily routine. The development of the ActiVis tool for nurses, and other visualization tools specific to family doctors and clinician researchers, is still ongoing and we plan to integrate them into an operational platform for health care professionals in Qatar in the near future."

A hierarchical multiple linear regression model was used to explain the relationship between the variables. The empirical results demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between the variables. HEI is the one that most influences on ECEO, followed by EI and CI. These results are a starting point to understanding how HEI, EI, and CI are related to ECEO; therefore, we invite researchers to develop more empirical studies in this field."

It summarizes the key findings for these domains from the earlier chapters while highlighting emblematic AI case uses. It considers financing advances, including in universal health coverage, public–private partnerships, digital global health diplomacy, finance tracking, and value-based health. This chapter moves on to integral sustainable development advances, including in AI for the sustainable development goals, precision agriculture, climate change, affordable clean energy, equity, and generative AI (including ChatGPT). It then considers data architecture advances, including in the United Kingdom’s hybrid data architecture, India’s federated data architecture, swarm learning, gossip learning, blockchain, edge computing, application programming interfaces, augmented public health intelligence, quantum computing, zero-trust security, blockchain, and data solidarity. This chapter then considers political economic advances particularly from the perspective of Political Liberalism–bridging democracies and autocracies, including in data governance models (spanning Europe’s general data protection regulation and Japan’s agile governance), managed strategic competition, and World Health Organization coordination. Finally, this chapter considers AI ethics for the health ecosystem. Particular emphasis is given to how population aging, multicultural diversity, and human security requires more inclusive discussion of diverse perspectives, as through Personalist Social Contract ethics to generate and sustain substantive convergence on the unifying values of human dignity, rights, and sovereignty that then give rise to effective and equitable collective action. This chapter concludes by applying the abovesaid dimensions to concrete AI use cases for the global public health ecosystem that illustrates this integral approach, including ethics by design or embedded AI ethics (within existing ecosystem operations and structures), democratizing AI or personalizing AI (as with end-to-end AI platforms and edge computing expanding and interlinking free and affordable AI services for larger audiences), and ecosystem interoperability (uniting political economic interoperability, data interoperability, and moral interoperability to leverage global resources and insights for local communities leading their own projects)."

This novel framework compares user-based valuations of accommodations derived from hedonic pricing with subjective, AI-generated neighborhood descriptions, offering new perspectives on data quality and reliability in information systems. The study also critically examines the challenges of integrating AI-generated content in information science, referencing also ‘Garbage-in Garbage-out’ and ‘Bullshit-in Bullshit-out’ concepts. Employing a multi-scalar modeling approach, the research examines Airbnb pricing dynamics across several U.S. cities, starting with Manhattan (USA) as an illustrative case. A subsequent large-scale application to additional metropolitan areas utilizes a combination of hedonic price modeling, social media data, and AI-generated urban descriptions, including a Shapley decomposition analysis.

We aim to explore whether the trust levels in multicultural and unicultural semi-virtual groups will be the same, how trust develops over time and what the corresponding factors to the trust development are. In order to answer the questions, a longitudinal case study was conducted in unicultural and multicultural teams. We have taken survey for 144 participants over three stages, as well as interviewed 64 participants. Results of the analysis of the survey data firstly show that no significant difference exists between multicultural and unicultural groups. Then, two factors, collaboration process and clear task help explain this phenomenon. However, the trust development of multicultural groups shows instability and keeps decreasing over time, while unicultural groups behave differently. We found that language, values and habitual behavior lead to the differences in these two types of groups."

This forceful paradigm shift, however, had contributed generously to the GDP of the country. Sarawak being the largest state in Malaysia, is expected to contribute the highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP), however, this is not the case. Nonetheless, the Sarawak State Government had deployed the Sarawak Digital Economy Strategy 2018-2022 blueprint as one of their initiatives to position Sarawak as a high-income state. To boost Sarawak's Digital Economy, promoting and implementing eCommerce is crucial. Yet, the key challenge lies in ensuring full acceptance and adoption of this transformative approach by all stakeholders. Therefore, this research was carried out to offer valuable insights to the state government regarding the factors that influence the sustainability of current eCommerce platforms in Sarawak. The date collected from Sarawakians served as the foundation for this study. Data from 130 individuals residing in Sarawak was collected through e-survey, employing a quantitative research method. The findings indicate that the sustainability of an eCommerce platform in Sarawak is influenced by the extent to which it aids users in achieving their objectives. Additionally, the Sarawak community's awareness of the advantages and risks associated with using eCommerce platforms was identified as another factor impacting platform sustainability. In summary, this study highlights significant factors that can contribute to the development of Sarawak's Digital Economy. By identifying these variables, it provides valuable insights that can serve as a call to action for the state government."

2018,"Health Care Professionals’ Attitudes Toward, and Experiences of Using, a Culture-Sensitive Smartphone App for Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Qualitative Study",Lisa Garnweidner-Holme and Therese {Hoel Andersen} and Mari Wastvedt Sando and Josef Noll and Mirjam Lukasse,https://doi.org/10.2196/mhealth.9686,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S229152221800219X,,,,"Background
The increasing prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among women of different ethnic backgrounds provides new challenges for health care professionals, who often find it difficult to provide information about the management of this disease to such individuals. Mobile health (mHealth) may act as a useful tool for blood sugar control and care process enhancement. However, little is known about health care professionals’ experiences and attitudes toward the use of mHealth for women with GDM.
Objective
The aim of this study was to explore how health care professionals perceived the provision of care to pregnant women who managed their GDM using the culture-sensitive Pregnant+ app in a randomized controlled trial.
Methods
Individual interviews with 9 health care professionals providing care for women with GDM were conducted. Braun and Clark’s method of thematic content analysis inspired the analysis. This study included health care professionals who were primarily responsible for providing care to participants with GDM in the Pregnant+ randomized controlled trial at 5 diabetes outpatient clinics in Oslo, Norway.
Results
Health care professionals perceived mHealth, particularly the Pregnant+ app, as an appropriate tool for the care of women with GDM, who were described as individuals comprising a heterogeneous, motivated group that could be easily approached with health-related information. Some participants reported challenges with respect to provision of advice to women with different food cultures. The advantages of the Pregnant+ app included provision of information that women could access at home, the information provided being perceived as trustworthy by health care professionals, the culture sensitivity of the app, and the convenience for women to register blood sugar levels. Technical problems, particularly those associated with the automatic transfer of blood glucose measurements, were identified as the main barrier to the use of the Pregnant+ app. Strict inclusion criteria and the inclusion of participants who could not speak Norwegian were the main challenges in the recruitment process for the randomized controlled trial.
Conclusions
The findings of this study suggest that mHealth is a useful tool to enhance the care provided by health care professionals to women with GDM. Future mobile apps for the management of GDM should be developed by a trustworthy source and in cooperation with health care professionals. They should also be culture sensitive and should not exhibit technical problems."

In particular, knowing that AI-MC tools are used by the communicator might reduce recipients' perceptions of the authenticity of emotionally charged messages, such as an apology. Across three scenario-based studies rooted in an interpersonal work-related conflict, we examined the effects of the choice to use AI-MC tools to communicate an apology, focusing on people's perceptions of the genuineness of the apology, and their ensuing tendency to forgive the person apologizing. We consistently found that the choice to use AI-MC tools diminished perceptions of the apology's authenticity and the consequent willingness to forgive, and that self-disclosing the use of AI-MC on the part of the communicator did not mitigate this effect. However, making limited use of AI-MC (selecting to use only one of three available tools) had no negative impact on the perceived authenticity of the apology, suggesting that limiting the use of AI-MC signals a diminished distance between the original intention of the person apologizing and the final formulation of the message of apology, leading to perceptions of a more genuine apology."

2023,"Immigrant, Refugee, and Indigenous Canadians’ Experiences With Virtual Health Care Services: Rapid Review",Megan MacPherson,https://doi.org/10.2196/47288,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2292949523000974,,,,"Background
The remote, dispersed, and multicultural population of Canada presents unique challenges for health care services. Currently, virtual care solutions are being offered as an innovative solution to improve access to care.
Objective
Given the inequities in health care access faced by immigrant, refugee, and Indigenous Canadians, this review aimed to summarize information obtained from original research regarding these people’s experiences with virtual care services in Canada.
Methods
We conducted a rapid review following published recommendations. MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for studies relating to virtual care and Canadian immigrants, refugees, or Indigenous peoples. Peer-reviewed articles of any type were included so long as they included information on the experiences of virtual care service delivery in Canada among the abovementioned groups.
Results
This review demonstrates an extreme paucity of evidence examining the experiences of immigrant, refugee, and Indigenous groups with virtual care in Canada. Of the 694 publications screened, 8 were included in this review. A total of 2 studies focused on immigrants and refugees in Canada, with the remaining studies focusing on Indigenous communities. Results demonstrate that virtual care is generally accepted within these communities; however, cultural appropriateness or safety and inequitable access to wireless services in certain communities were among the most cited barriers.
Conclusions
Little evidence exists outlining immigrants’, refugees’, and Indigenous peoples’ perspectives on the landscape of virtual care in Canada. The development of virtual care programming should take into consideration the barriers, facilitators, and recommendations outlined in this review to improve equitable access. Further, developers should consult with local community members to ensure the appropriateness of services for immigrant, refugee, and Indigenous communities in Canada."

Serious games have proved to be effective and highly motivational educational tools capable of increasing awareness, changing behaviour, reduce risk factors and even improving protective skills. This paper presents a novel approach of using both participatory design and gameplay to sensitize children (aged 7–12​ years old) on bullying victimization. Action research strategy is used with intentions to improve the quality of school life in Japan through the use of a serious game called Shimpai Muyou. What makes it stand out from the rest of the crowd is that the entire intervention was design, developed and evaluated through partnering with children in a school setting. The research is largely qualitative and exploratory in nature, stemmed from interdisciplinary core ideas related to technology, education, psychology and interactive theatre. Findings from both formative and summative evaluations indicated that child-users empathically engaged with the synthetic characters, attributing a range of emotions to their actions e.g., empathy, compassion, sadness, anger etc., tackling ethical dilemmas and bullying situations with confidence. From these results, we can conclude that Shimpai Muyou is a useful and engaging school-based anti-bullying intervention."

In the healthcare and biomedical research domain, applications depending on electronic health records (EHRs) identify privacy preservation as a major concern. Existing solutions cannot always satisfy the evolving research demands such as linking patient records across organizational boundaries due to the potential for patient re-identification. In this work, we show how semantic methods can be applied to support the formulation and enforcement of access control policy whilst ensuring that privacy leakage can be detected and prevented. The work is illustrated through a case study associated with the Australasian Diabetes Data Network (ADDN – www.addn.org.au), the national paediatric type-1 diabetes data registry, and the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN – www.aurin.org.au) platform that supports Australia-wide access to urban and built environment data sets. We demonstrate that through extending the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) with semantic capabilities, finer-grained access control encompassing data risk disclosure mechanisms can be supported. We discuss the contributions that can be made using this approach to socio-economic development and political management within business systems, and especially those situations where secure data access and data linkage is required."

While previous research has highlighted the role of social networks in opinion evolution, the dynamics of information dissemination and its interaction with these networks are less understood. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Social-Information-Opinion Dynamic Supernetwork (SIO-DS) model, which integrates critical factors such as the impact of external information and opinion propagation, alongside the influence of internal social network structures and individual willingness to adjust opinions. This model takes into account the varied levels of confidence and individualized dynamic influence among decision makers, recognizing both their asymmetry and diversity. It performs opinion dynamics using bounded confidence models and parameters that govern information dissemination. We found that scale-free networks, which feature influential leaders, are more effective at reaching consensus compared to small-world networks, which are hindered by limited inter-group connections. The speed of information dissemination is critical; moderate speeds help in maintaining a stable consensus by balancing social influence, while very fast or slow speeds risk exacerbating polarization based on how social influence is managed. The SIO-DS model has broad implications for enhancing decision-making in corporate management by optimizing network structures, in public policy by managing public opinion, and in crisis management by developing effective communication strategies. Ultimately, this model not only deepens our understanding of opinion dynamics but also provides practical tools for improving decision-making quality and efficiency in various contexts."

For this very reason, the implementation of online resource allocation algorithms in the BaseBand Unit (BBU) pool for handling loads of multiple Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) is one of the most motivating challenges in C-RAN. Those centralized algorithms must be able to handle efficiently interference between users, as well as to dynamically select RRHs that can be turned on/off based on traffic variation. By doing so, the total RRHs transmission power can be minimized and the number of active BBUs within the cloud can also be reduced. In this paper, the issues of dynamic wireless resource allocation, transmission power minimization and BBU-RRH assignment in downlink C-RAN are addressed in one framework. We have previously attempted to address these problems by proposing a approach based on the branch-and-cut algorithm to solve small instances of the problem to optimality. However, due to the combinatorial complexity of the problem, finding optimal solutions for a large-scale network may take a fair amount of time and will not be suitable for online optimization. Towards this end, we propose a novel two-stage approach to address these issues for a large-scale problem. The first stage is a new proposal that addresses the problems of dynamic resource allocation and power minimization in C-RAN using a simulated annealing approach with a specific neighborhood search program. The BBU-RRH assignment is handled in the second stage using a multiple knapsack formulation. Through extensive event-based simulations, our proposal achieves significant reduction in time complexity and yields near optimal performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."
2018,A novel sensing and primary user protection algorithm for cognitive radio network using IoT,Vivek Rajpoot and Vijay Shanker Tripathi,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phycom.2018.06.010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874490717306432,,,,"Internet of things (IoT) is a technology which facilitates passive devices to participate in active communication. In the presented work the radio frequency identification (RFID) system is used to access information from passive primary receiver (PURx). This inspires to develop a novel sensing algorithm along with PURx protection from harmful transmissions of cognitive radio (CR) nodes in CR network. The novelty in the sensing and protection lies in the approach of accessing information from primary users. Here a CR node can detect occupancy of primary channel from both, primary transmitter (PUTx) end as well as from PURx end on the basis of relative distance. For protection of PURx a novel power control algorithm is proposed and implemented. The results indicate less energy is needed to run the network along with a notable improvement in average throughput and reduction in delay for increasing amount of CR traffic."
2025,Toward accurate psychological simulations: Investigating LLMs’ responses to personality and cultural variables,Chihao Li and Yue Qi,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2025.108687,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563225001347,,,,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated complex language comprehension, making them potential tools for psychological research. However, challenges remain in assessing their psychological properties, particularly regarding prompt design, comparison with human data, and the ability to simulate real-world psychological differences across cultural groups. This study investigates how LLMs respond to personality assessments and cultural variables, addressing gaps in previous research. In three studies, we explored the impact of model parameters and prompt variations on LLM responses to personality tests. Study 1 examined how temperature, model type, and prompt templates influenced LLM responses, revealing that while temperature settings had minimal impact, prompt variations led to significant differences. Study 2 compared LLMs' self-report personality scores with human data (N = 18,192–49,159), finding that LLMs scored higher in positive traits (e.g., extroversion) and lower in negative traits (e.g., psychopathy), reflecting their training biases. Study 3 tested LLMs’ ability to simulate cultural differences by assessing virtual subjects from China and the USA. While significant differences were observed between the groups, both demonstrated East Asian self-construal patterns, indicating limitations in simulating authentic cultural psychological differences. These findings highlight the influence of prompt design on LLM responses, the divergence between LLM and human personality profiles, and the difficulty of simulating accurate cultural psychological differences. These results underscore the need for more refined methodologies in psychological simulations using LLMs and suggest that current models struggle to represent diverse human psychological traits accurately."

JeanetteWing’s seminal work on Computational Thinking (CT) is an important landmark for this goal: CT represents a way of thinking, a set of problem-solving skills which can be valuable when interacting with digital technologies, and with different fields of knowledge, such as Arts and Humanities. Even if this cross-areas relevance has been celebrated and acknowledged in theoretical research, there has been a lack of practical projects exploring these links between CT and non-STEM fields. This research develops these links. We present a specific case – a game produced by two 14 years-old boys – within Playing Beowulf, a collaboration with the British library’s Young Researchers programme, in which students aged 13–14 from an inner-London (UK) school have developed games based on their own readings of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf during an after-school club. The game was produced using MissionMaker, a software (currently under development at UCL Knowledge Lab) that allows users to create and code their own first-person 3D games in a simple way, using pre-made 3D assets, such as rooms, props, characters and weapons and a simplified programming language manipulated through drop-down lists. We argue that MissionMaker, by simplifying the development process (low floor), can be a means to foster the building of knowledge in both STEM (CT) and Arts and Humanities, building bridges between these two areas inside and outside traditional schooling."

This study describes an embedded mixed-method research evaluation of an eight-week touchscreen mobile device training for thirty-nine older adults who were recruited from a community center in a low Internet usage area in southern Taiwan. Among the participants, 20 completed both the pre-test and the post-test and 16 attended the focus group interviews. The design of the training course was based on constructs informed by the diffusion of innovation theory and the technology acceptance model, and it incorporated both a classroom-based and small group tutoring approach. After the training session, the participants reported significantly lower depressive symptom scores compared to baseline. Qualitative interviews reveal the participants’ learning needs related to extended practice, usefulness, and compatibility in adopting touch-screen apps. Findings from this study shed light on the possibility of touchscreen-based apps, including health-, entertainment-, transportation-, and social media-related apps, for improving psychological well-being in older adults with limited Internet experience living in the community. Discussion on their learning needs was also provided."

We accomplish this through fine-tuning experiments using a state-of-the-art CNN and via rigorous architecture analysis, we present several modifications that lead to accuracy improvements over prior art on a dataset of images from a popular social media platform. We additionally present visualizations of local patterns that the network learned to associate with image sentiment for insight into how visual positivity (or negativity) is perceived by the model."

Recently, we have seen a dramatic change in favour of distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemics, therefore, it could be useful to analyse the impact of social media in FLL as they have been used much more now. It is a study summarizing the most important findings of the most recent research into the impact of social media on L2 acquisition from the psycholinguistic perspective. The paper analyses data from research papers as they appear in Scopus and Web of Science databases in the past ten years (i.e. 2010-2020). The purpose of the study is to describe the current research findings, to analyse their importance, to compare the most important data, and to look for further development of the psycholinguistics of L2. Its primary intention is to look into the acquisition of L2, particularly English as a second language (ESL) in the younger generation, i.e., Generation Z of current university students. It also attempts to highlight both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in L2 acquisition and therefore to highlight future strategies regarding FLL in university education. The current research in this area provides us with overtly optimistic results in FLL with the assistance of social media, however, the paper claims that the situation of utilizing social media in FLL needs further investigation and analysis, mainly from the psycholinguistic point of view. The current COVID-19 situation makes us aware that the impact of social media will increase due to social distancing."

2025,Using Generative Adversarial Networks for the synthesis of emotional facial expressions in virtual educational environments,William Villegas-Ch and Alexandra {Maldonado Navarro} and Araceli Mera-Navarrete,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iswa.2025.200479,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667305325000055,,,,"The generation of emotional facial expressions using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been widely researched, achieving significant advances in creating high-quality images. However, one of the main challenges remains the accurate transmission of complex and negative emotions, such as anger or sadness, due to the difficulty of correctly capturing the facial micro gestures that characterize these emotions. Traditional GAN architectures, such as StyleGAN and DCGAN, have proven highly effective in synthesizing positive emotions such as joy. However, they have limitations regarding more subtle emotions, leading to a higher rate of false negatives. In response to this problem, we propose fine-tuning the GAN discriminator. This tuning optimizes the discriminator’s ability to identify the minor details in facial expressions by using perceptual losses, allowing for better differentiation between the generated emotions, reducing classification errors, and improving precision in difficult-to-represent emotions. The results obtained in this study demonstrate a significant improvement in the system’s precision, especially in complex emotions. Precision for the anger emotion increased from 85.7% to 89.1%, and the number of false negatives was reduced from 16 to 10. Overall, precision for complex emotions exceeded 85%, substantially improving traditional solutions. These results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuning the GAN architecture for applications requiring more faithful and effective emotional interaction, significantly improving user experience across multiple domains."
2023,Backsourcing of IT with focus on software development—A systematic literature review,Jefferson Seide Molléri and Casper Lassenius and Magne Jørgensen,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2023.111771,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121223001668,,,,"Context:
Backsourcing is the process of insourcing previously outsourced activities. Backsourcing can be a viable alternative when companies experience environmental or strategic changes, or challenges with outsourcing. While outsourcing and related processes have been extensively studied, few studies report experiences with backsourcing.
Objectives:
We summarize the results of the research literature on backsourcing of IT, with a focus on software development. By identifying practically relevant experience, we present findings that may help companies considering backsourcing. In addition, we identify gaps in the current research literature and point out areas for future work.
Method:
Our systematic literature review (SLR) started with a search for empirical studies on the backsourcing of IT. From each study, we identified the context in which backsourcing occurred, the factors leading to the decision, the backsourcing process, and the outcomes of backsourcing. We employed inductive coding to extract textual data from the papers and qualitative cross-case analysis to synthesize the evidence.
Results:
We identified 17 papers that reported 26 cases of backsourcing, six of which were related to software development. The cases came from a variety of contexts. The most common reasons for backsourcing were improving quality, reducing costs, and regaining control of outsourced activities. We model the backsourcing process as containing five sub-processes: change management, vendor relationship management, competence building, organizational build-up, and transfer of ownership. We identified 14 positive outcomes and nine negative outcomes of backsourcing. We also aggregated the evidence and detailed three relationships of potential use to companies considering backsourcing. Finally, we have highlighted the knowledge areas of software engineering associated with the backsourcing of software development.
Conclusion:
The backsourcing of IT is a complex process; its implementation depends on the prior outsourcing relationship and other contextual factors. Our systematic literature review contributes to a better understanding of this process by identifying its components and their relationships based on the peer-reviewed literature. Our results can serve as a motivation and baseline for further research on backsourcing and provide guidelines and process fragments from which practitioners can benefit when they engage in backsourcing."
2020,Network Support Using Social Networking Services to Increase Exercise Adherence Among Korean-Chinese Middle-Aged Migrant Women: Mixed Methods Study,Hyeyeon Lee and Hyeonkyeong Lee and Youlim Kim and Sookyung Kim and Young-Me Lee,https://doi.org/10.2196/19159,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2291522220001278,,,,"Background
Social networking services (SNSs) are recognized to be a promising approach to easily deliver health interventions and to enhance social support for exercise adherence. However, the patterns and aspects of social support through SNSs have not been reported and their influence on other social-cognitive factors remains inconclusive.
Objective
Our objective is to explore how social support delivered through SNSs impacts interactions among Korean-Chinese (KC) middle-aged women and to identify how this approach influences social-cognitive factors for exercise (eg, sense of community, self-efficacy for exercise, and social support for exercise).
Methods
A mixed methods design was used. Text analysis of SNS messages and text mining using the Korean Natural Language Application (KoALA) were conducted. Social-cognitive factors (eg, sense of community, self-efficacy for exercise, and social support for exercise) were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks using a structured questionnaire. A comparison of social-cognitive factors at baseline and at 12 weeks was conducted to identify any potential significant changes, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results
A total of 259 SNS messages were collected from 24 KC women, distributed among four chat groups, who participated in a 12-week walking intervention program between August and October 2018. The individual average frequency of chatting via the SNS was 10.79 (range 0-34) and the most frequent type of social support through the SNS was network support (172/259, 66.4%). The most common words extracted from the SNS were Health, Exercise, Participation, and We. Overall, the perceived levels of sense of community (P<.001) and social support for exercise (P=.002) were significantly increased at 12 weeks compared with baseline. Group 1 (P=.03) and Group 4 (P=.03), whose members demonstrated the highest frequency of network support, experienced a significant increase only in the level of sense of community.
Conclusions
By integrating these data and conducting a mixed methods analysis, we observed that among the types of social support, network support was a key point for the promotion of social-cognitive factors in increasing exercise adherence. Therefore, network support through SNS-based interventions should be considered as a useful strategy to help vulnerable migrant populations make changes to exercise behaviors."

This study aims to combine cultural ergonomics and interactive design to explore human–culture interaction in user experiences. The linnak is a typical Taiwanese aboriginal cultural object. This study examined the cultural meaning and operational interface of the linnak, as well as the scenarios in which it is used in interaction and user experiences. The results produced a cultural ergonomics interface for examining the manner in which designers communicate across cultures as well as the interweaving of design and culture in the design process."

The present research takes a bibliographic approach to shed light on current research on AR in human-computer interaction and, using topic modeling, to identify and classify the topics that have drawn researchers’ interest. The results reveal three major topics of interest to researchers, namely “Education, Learning & Training Research”, “Marketing, Consumer Behavior & Business Research”, and “Digital Tourism & Cultural Heritage Research”. Drawing upon co-authorship theory, we identify prominent AR expert co-authorship networks that work on similar topics, yet also highlight that AR research is concentrated in a few research groups that publish articles with similar groups of authors and little outside their own networks. Together with AR experts from the four largest co-authorship networks, we highlight the common challenges that emerge in AR research, suggest solutions, and jointly propose a research agenda for AR and human behavior research."

Given the recent rise in online hate targeting immigrants, this study examines factors that bring individuals into virtual contact with such material. Utilizing recently collected online survey data of American youth and young adults, we draw on insights from Routine Activity Theory and Social Structure-Social Learning Theory to understand exposure to anti-immigrant online hate material. Specifically, we consider how online routines, location in social structure, and social identity are associated with exposure. Results indicate that engaging in behaviors that can increase proximity to motivated offenders increases the likelihood of being exposed to anti-immigrant hate, as does engaging in online behaviors that bolster one's target suitability. Additionally, individuals who view Americanism as fundamental to their social identity are more apt to encounter anti-immigrant hate material on the Internet, as are those who are more dissatisfied with the current direction of the country."

Challenges faced included: integrating written and oral forms of communication; revising and deconstructing the design tools; and overcoming colonized notions of time and futures. We argue that transdisciplinary design methods and interventions have the potential to contribute to peacebuilding but need to be constantly decolonised and consider what the future means for communities affected by conflict."

To better understand and evaluate it, we defined urban vitality from the perspective of the urban organism and proposed the “vital triangle” conceptual framework linked to the three aspects of growth, diversity, and mobility. We designed an evaluation index system that includes the six dimensions of population, economy, society, government, environment, and external links by integrating multiple sets of heterogeneous data, and applied it to cities in the Yangtze River Delta. The results show that Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou have the highest vitality levels but are weak regarding their eco-environments. Cities with high vitality are distributed on the Z-shaped key development belt of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration planning. Regional differences in external links and population vitality are significant, and these two dimensions pose weaknesses to many cities. The interregional differences linked to social vitality are the smallest. Vitality not only comes from within the urban system, but also greatly depends on the external environment. The concept “vital triangle” and relevant evaluation framework are intended to serve as a basis for future research, and the case study could provide some key decision-making support for urban planning and management."

As user research teams and organizations have become more common, it has become a larger problem to communicate insight from the user research to the whole product team, so that everyone can see what matters. Contextual Design has always used models of the user to communicate; with Contextual Design 2.0, we've expanded those models to communicate the aspects of design that matter for today's highly connected technology. In this chapter we discuss the problems of representing user data to reveal what is going on across an entire market."

The current literature is very extensive and covers a wide variety of deterministic and stochastic models. However, with the increase in computing resources, new, more general, and flexible procedures based on simulation models can assess the effectiveness of measures and quantify the current state of the epidemic. This paper illustrates the potential of this approach to build a new dynamic probabilistic model to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in different compartments. Methods: We propose a new probabilistic model in which, for the first time in the epidemic literature, parameter learning is carried out using gradient-free stochastic black-box optimization techniques simulating multiple trajectories of the infection dynamics in a general way, solving an inverse problem that is defined employing the daily information from mortality records. Results: After the application of the new proposal in Spain in the first and successive waves, the result of the model confirms the accuracy to estimate the seroprevalence and allows us to know the real dynamics of the pandemic a posteriori to assess the impact of epidemiological measures by the Spanish government and to plan more efficiently the subsequent decisions with the prior knowledge obtained. Conclusions:The model results allow us to estimate the daily patterns of COVID-19 infections in Spain retrospectively and examine the population’s exposure to the virus dynamically in contrast to seroprevalence surveys. Furthermore, given the flexibility of our simulation framework, we can model situations —even using non-parametric distributions between the different compartments in the model— that other models in the existing literature cannot. Our general optimization strategy remains valid in these cases, and we can easily create other non-standard simulation epidemic models that incorporate more complex and dynamic structures."

Three tasks commonly found in e-commerce sites (Point & Click, Drag & Drop and Item Selection) were tested by 592 volunteers and their performance was analyzed using several different statistical methods. The study found consistencies in the execution times of individuals across the different tasks and revealed that age and gender are sufficiently determining factors to support an automatic profiling. Results also showed that relevant information about gender and age can be extracted separately through the individual analysis of each one of the mentioned interaction tasks."

Previous studies have identified that the effective management of cyber security in large health care environments is likely to be significantly impacted by human and social factors, as well as by technical controls. However, there have been limited attempts to confirm this by using measured and integrated studies to identify specific user motivations and behaviors that can be managed to achieve improved outcomes.
Objective
This study aims to document and analyze survey and interview data from a diverse range of health care staff members, to determine the primary motivations and behaviors that influence their acceptance and application of cyber security messaging and controls. By identifying these issues, recommendations can be made to positively influence future cyber security governance in health care.
Methods
An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach was undertaken to analyze quantitative data from a web-based staff survey (N=103), with a concurrent qualitative investigation applied to data gathered via in-depth staff interviews (N=9). Data from both stages of this methodology were mapped to descriptive variables based on a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM; TAM2). After normalization, the quantitative data were verified and analyzed using descriptive statistics, distribution and linearity measures, and a bivariate correlation of the TAM variables to identify the Pearson coefficient (r) and significance (P) values. Finally, after confirming Cronbach α, the determinant score for multicollinearity, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure, and applying the Bartlett test of sphericity (χ2), an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify the primary factors with an eigenvalue (λ) >1.0. Comments captured during the qualitative interviews were coded using NVivo software (QSR International) to create an emic-to-etic understanding, which was subsequently integrated with the quantitative results to produce verified conclusions.
Results
Using the explanatory sequential methodology, this study showed that the perceived usefulness of security controls emerged as the most significant factor influencing staff beliefs and behaviors. This variable represented 24% of all the variances measured in the EFA and was also the most common category identified across all coded interviews (281/692, 40.6%). The word frequency analysis showed that systems, patients, and people represented the top 3 recurring themes reported by the interviewees.
Conclusions
To improve cyber security governance in large health care environments, efforts should be focused on demonstrating how confidentiality, integrity, availability, policies, and cloud or vendor-based controls (the main contributors of usefulness measured by the EFA) can directly improve outcomes for systems, staff, and patients. Further consideration also needs to be given to how clinicians should share data and collaborate on patient care, with tools and processes provided to support and manage data sharing securely and to achieve a consistent baseline of secure and normalized behaviors."

Exploring practitioners’ perspectives through an international survey,Carine Lallemand and Guillaume Gronier and Vincent Koenig,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.048,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214005718,,,,"For more than a decade, User Experience (UX) has grown into a core concept of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI). Practitioners and researchers from a wide range of disciplines are daily working with this concept. However, despite many attempts to understand, define and scope UX, one may still wonder whether a consensus has been reached on this concept. In a willingness to address the complexity of this research topic and bring the concept of UX to maturity, a replication of an international survey has been conducted. The main goal of the present study is to get a better understanding of practitioners’ viewpoints on the notion of UX and to analyze potential evolutions over time in the understanding and practical use of the concept. As both practical and theoretical implications of UX are of the greatest importance for whoever designs interactive systems, the exploration of practitioners’ perspectives is a valuable step toward continual improvement of UX activities. The present survey has been conducted amongst 758 practitioners and researchers from 35 nationalities. It allows to better understand how this concept is understood and used throughout the world. Amongst interesting results, important differences were observed according to the geographical location and background of the respondents."

Although not formally recognised as an educational model, the first steps towards embracing crowdsourcing as a form of formal learning and teaching have recently emerged. Before taking a dramatic step forward, it should be estimated whether it is feasible, sustainable and socially responsible. A nice initiative, which intends to set a groundwork for responsible research and innovation and actively implement crowdsourcing for language learning of all citizens regardless of their diversified social, educational, and linguistic backgrounds is enetCollect. In order to achieve these goals, a sound framework that embraces the ethical and legal considerations should be established. The framework is intended for all the current and prospective creators of crowd-oriented educational systems. It incorporates the ethical issues affecting the three stakeholders: collaborative content creators, prospective users, as well as the institutions intending to implement the approach for educational purposes. The proposed framework offers a practical solution intending to overcome the revealed barriers, which might increase the risk of compromising its main educational goals. If carefully designed and implemented, crowdsourcing might become a very helpful, and at the same time, a very reliable educational model."
2022,Measuring the cost-effectiveness of using telehealth for diabetes management: A narrative review of methods and findings,Ofir Ben-Assuli,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2022.104764,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505622000788,,,,"Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by high levels of blood glucose, which can lead over time to severe impairment to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, nerves and premature death. Diabetes is prone to complications such as kidney failure, vision loss and nerve damage. The total assessed cost of diagnosed diabetes is growing rapidly; hence, harnessing telehealth for diabetes management may be cost-effective. A few previous publications have pointed to the effectiveness of telehealth but more numerous articles indicate that the results are inconsistent and economic models are lacking. This narrative review surveys the recent literature on the implementation of telehealth for diabetes management that incorporates cost-effectiveness analyses.
Materials and methods
This paper follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [25].
Results
The vast majority of articles dealing with managing Type 2 diabetes have primarily used the telephone for telehealth monitoring (followed by teleophalmology and telemonitoring). Most publications report that the telehealth solution was cost effective. The leading cost-effectiveness method was the Markov model; however, only a small number of papers extend the Markov model to critical sensitivity analyses of their outcomes. The main goal of telehealth in general is diabetes management or monitoring, followed by ophthalmology, depression management, weight loss and other goals.
Conclusion
This work summarizes the literature on recent trends in telehealth options, and analyzes successes and failures in relation to both effectiveness and costs, which may be valuable to both scholars and practitioners."
2025,A hybrid detection method for YouTube fake news using related video data,Junho Kim and Yongjun Shin and Gyeongho Jung and Hyunchul Ahn,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2025.111130,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197625011315,,,,"Fake news has rapidly evolved from simple textual forms to complex multimedia content, with YouTube emerging as a major platform for its dissemination. However, most existing detection techniques focus solely on content-based features, often overlooking the contextual signals embedded in related video data. We propose a novel hybrid detection framework that integrates content- and context-based approaches to address this limitation. Our method combines multimodal features extracted from textual and visual components of the original video, along with contextual information from related videos. Text data is processed using word embedding techniques, while image and visual elements are analyzed through Convolutional Neural Networks. To evaluate our framework's robustness and generalizability, we conducted experiments on two complementary datasets: a publicly available multilingual dataset and a newly constructed Korean dataset. The results show that the proposed method achieves a 0.1–9.7 % improvement in detection accuracy compared to traditional content-only approaches. These findings underscore the value of leveraging related video information for more reliable fake news detection, and they confirm that our hybrid method can be effectively applied across diverse language and regional contexts. Our work contributes to mitigating the societal harm caused by misinformation on video-sharing platforms and offers practical insights into developing more robust multimedia fake news detection systems."
2017,From technical to non-technical skills among information systems suppliers,Bénédicte Branchet and Pierre-Yves Sanseau,https://doi.org/10.1108/JEIM-07-2015-0061,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1741039817000237,,,,"Purpose
Existing research infers that in the information systems (IS) and information technology (IT) fields, a shift may occur between technical and non-technical skills. However, relatively little research has focused on going changes in terms of key skills in the IS suppliers sector. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap by investigating these skills evolution in the IS suppliers domain and discusses their impacts on IS and IT curricula.
Design/methodology/approach
This paper uses a qualitative method based on 15 semi-structured face-to-face interviews, with highly dedicated operational managers in senior positions in the field.
Findings
This study identifies, for the IS suppliers, the critical skills, which are basically non-technical, and peripheral skills, which are primarily technical. It then considers the consequences of this change and the necessary adaptations it requires for businesses and training for this field.
Practical implications
The findings suggest the need to redesign the educational curricula for future managers, and the adaptations required to the work organization, human resource management and business models of firms in the field.
Originality/value
The paper’s value is twofold. First, it focuses on IS service suppliers, an understudied area (most research examines IS outsourcing from the customer’s standpoint); second, it reveals the shift away from technical toward non-technical skills in a field that is intrinsically technical – a change that may occur more slowly than in other less technical sectors – and the consequences of this change for firms, education and society."

In order to identify the mechanism and specific circumstances of flaming, this study employed emotional contagion as the main theoretical framework and conducted a 2 (argument presented in a news article: support gun control vs. against gun control) × 2 (volume of negative comments: small vs. large) × 2 (news readers’ pre-existing beliefs: support gun control vs. against gun control) between-subjects experiment. Participants were asked to read an online news article about a gun-related topic as well as negative reader comments before they wrote a comment of their own. The experimental results showed that participants were more likely to use swear words in their comments when their viewpoint was diametrically opposed to the argument presented in the news article and when the article was accompanied by a low volume of negative comments. This interaction effect was mediated by negative emotions that participants experienced when reading the article and its associated comments. These findings have theoretical implications for future research pertaining to the identification of online circumstances and causes that could help mitigate the occurrence of flaming."

This way, no hooks have to be inserted in the gamified system other than reporting of basic events happening within it. The proposed notation allows to design gamification rules that can be applied to different gamified systems, only provided they can generate event reports using the proposed representation (and belong to the same domain so that the rules remain relevant). It also simplifies building of rule-processing systems that serve various gamified systems. It is especially useful for complex gamification systems with multiple sources of rules and multiple points of their processing."

Errors made at a higher decision level generate, as a result of wrong decisions in the operation of the ship, serious consequences, including the loss of the ship. A higher qualification level decreases the probability of improper operation of the ship while increasing the level of safety of navigation, which the ship is a participant of. Expert systems are a modern tool which can support and automate decision making at sea as well as assist ship owners in the selection of competent deck and machine crew. The article presents as an example of a possible use of artificial intelligence, the application of an expert system which is designed to support a ship owner in managing ships’ machine crews in the aspect of shipping safety."

Johnson and Rochelle J. Mendonca,"The World Health Organization in “Rehabilitation 2030: A Call for Action” describes a mismatch between the global need for rehabilitation, the growing issues seen in the numbers of patients that need care, and the availability of resources. The shortage of health professionals, rehabilitation therapists, nurses and doctors, and persons capable of taking care of the growing numbers of people with disabilities are major causes of this gap in healthcare. Evidence suggests that rehabilitation robots, which include therapeutic and assistive robots, can support neurorehabilitation of persons with neurological injuries and help bridge this care gap. Currently, the impact of rehabilitation robotics has not been inclusive, and access to the potential benefits of these technologies is unequal. Unfortunately, robot technology-assisted rehabilitation solutions are expensive, and as a result, they are primarily available in high-income countries (HICs). Solutions that are appropriate for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are rare and so their availability and impact in these countries are low. Given the potential of these solutions to bridge resource gaps, we must consider innovative ways to increase their inclusivity. This chapter raises general and ethical issues around access to rehabilitation robot technologies and discusses them in the context of inclusivity—a term that encompasses affordability and other common issues that may justify limiting or increasing use in low-resource settings in HICs and LMICs. We suggest that inclusivity can be increased if we address typical concerns and barriers to equal access for their rehabilitation use by diverse populations. The first section describes the motivation for this chapter. The second section briefly discusses these barriers from the lens of access, ethics—justice, privacy, safety, and autonomy; affordability; and finally, feasibility, usability, and acceptance. The third section details a potential practice framework for increasing inclusivity."

Through a survey of 996 self-identified Hispanic respondents in the U.S., it was found that English social media usage helped them develop strong orientation toward the mainstream American culture, while Spanish social media consumption reinforced their ethnic Hispanic cultural identification. This study further examined whether Hispanics with various demographic characteristics used social media differently and acculturated into the American society to different degrees."
2023,Soft skills required from software professionals in New Zealand,Matthias Galster and Antonija Mitrovic and Sanna Malinen and Jay Holland and Pasan Peiris,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2023.107232,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584923000861,,,,"Context:
Soft skills (e.g., communication) significantly contribute to software project success.
Objective:
We aim to understand (a) what are relevant soft skills in software engineering, (b) how soft skills relate to characteristics of hiring organizations, and (c) how reliably we can automatically identify soft skills in job adverts to support their continuous analysis. We focus on soft skills required by organizations in New Zealand, a country with a small but growing software sector characterized by a skills shortage, reliance on offshoring, and embedded in a bi-cultural context.
Method:
We manually analyzed 530 job adverts from New Zealand’s largest portal for technology-related positions. We identified soft skills following an inductive approach, i.e., without pre-defined soft skills. We complemented the manual analysis with an automated analysis using Flexiterm (an approach for term recognition).
Results:
We found explicit references to soft skills in 82% of adverts. Adverts from recruitment agencies (compared to hiring companies) included fewer soft skills. We identified 17 soft skills and proposed a contextualized software engineering description. Communication-related skills are most in demand. Soft skills related to broader human or societal values (e.g., empathy, cultural awareness) or distributed development are not common. Soft skills do not depend on company size or core business and domain of companies, or whether a company operates globally. Automatically identifying soft skills in adverts is error-prone.
Conclusions:
Employers explicitly ask for soft skills. Our findings support previous studies that highlight the importance of communication. On the other hand, identified soft skills only partially overlap with those reported in other skills classifications. Characteristics specific to New Zealand do not impact the demand for soft skills. Our findings benefit researchers in human aspects of software engineering and to those responsible for staff, curricula and professional development."
2022,Consulting the Oracle: A Delphi study for determining parameters for a mental health user profile and personalization strategy for an online service to aid grieving older adults,Lena Brandl and Miriam Cabrita and Jeannette Brodbeck and Dirk Heylen and Lex {van Velsen},https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2022.100534,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782922000410,,,,"While much effort has been devoted to the development of mental e-health interventions, the tailoring of these applications to user characteristics and needs is a comparatively novel field of research. The premise of personalizing mental e-health interventions is that personalization increases user motivation and (thereby) mitigates intervention dropout and enhances clinical effectiveness. In this study, we selected user profile parameters for personalizing a mental e-health intervention for older adults who lost their spouse. We conducted a three-round Delphi study involving an international and interdisciplinary expert panel (N = 16) with two objectives. The first aim was to elicit adaptation strategies that can be used to dynamically readjust the intervention to the user's needs. The second aim was to identify a set of meaningful indicators for monitoring the user from within the grief intervention to escalate from self-help to blended care, whenever advisable. This Delphi study used as starting point an evaluated, text-based grief intervention composed of ten modules, including psychoeducation about grief and cognitive-behavioral exercises to support the user in adjusting their lives after bereavement. Every user follows this grief intervention in a linear fashion from beginning to end. The resulting conceptual adaptation model encompasses dynamic adjustments, as well as one-time adjustments performed at the initialization of the service. On the level of the application structure, the adaptations affect when which topic module is presented to the user. The adaptations further provide strategies for adjusting the text-based content of individual intervention modules dependent on user characteristics and for selecting appropriate reactions to user input. Eighteen monitoring parameters were elicited and grouped into four categories: clinical, behavioral/emotional, interactive, and external. Parameters that were perceived as most urgent to attend to for escalation were Suicidality, Self-destructive behavior, Client-initiated escalation, Unresponsiveness and (Complicated) Grief symptoms."

The use of new technologies in the decision-making process seems to minimize the risk within the analyzed problem, although it still leaves out some space for critical human factors. It leads to the conclusion that apart from risk, the inherent category of reality perception, is the category of trust."

At present, the urban heat environmental condition is feared to gradually worsen in the future. By applying a new design that modifies the heat environment by creating organically linked neighborhood green spaces, which encourage pedestrian use, will assist in efforts to conserve and improve the town as a sustainable heritage site. In this research, areas with future greening potential are first extracted based on field surveys and the results of overlaid site appraisals that, by using computer simulations, account for pedestrian thermal comfort, visibility of the historical landscape, and movement. Based on the identified and extracted areas with greening potential, three neighborhood greening scenarios are established: case 1 is based on the existing conditions, case 2 is based on following existing conservation plans, and case 3 is based on maximizing green areas by implementing the proposed pedestrian walkway. A microclimate simulation was done for each scenario and the results are compared specifically from the viewpoint of where and how much each scenario contributes to mitigating the urban heat environment, focusing on changes in physiologically equivalent temperature distribution and numerical changes. From the results, we conclude that the streetscape conservation-oriented neighborhood greening approaches proposed herein should improve the urban heat environment in such historical towns in tropical regions."

House attributes, such as size and number of bedrooms, are currently being employed to perform the estimation by professional appraisers and researchers. Numerous algorithms have been proposed; however, a better assessment performance is still expected by the market. Nowadays, there are more available relevant data from various sources in urban areas, which have a potential impact on the house value. In this paper, we propose to fuse urban data, i.e., metadata and imagery data, with house attributes to unveil the market value of the property in Philadelphia. Specifically, two deep neural networks, i.e., metadata fusion network and image appraiser, are proposed to extract the representations, i.e., expected levels, from metadata and street-view images, respectively. A boosted regression tree (BRT) is adapted to estimate the market values of houses with the fused metadata and expected levels. The experimental results with the data collected from the city of Philadelphia demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The research presented in this paper also provides the real estate industry a new reference to the property value assessment with the data fusion methodology."

In order to address such research gap, the objective of this present article is to provide a review of academic, peer-reviewed journal studies that examined the potential effect of social media engagement on international university students’ acculturation process, coping strategies, and psychological adjustments during the period from 2010 to 2019. Moreover, building upon conceptualizations from new media and transcultural research literature, a conceptual framework was developed to classify the relevant studies for further analysis. Overall, these theories and studies synthesized in this paper emphasize the vital role of social media in the acculturation, coping behaviors and mental health for ethnic minorities in the host country. Additionally, certain dimensions of attitudes and behaviors through social media could exert the important influence on the psychological adaption. Therefore, conclusions of the research may assist to further inform practitioners who may encounter newcomers’ experiencing intercultural adjustments and psychological issues in the digital media age. Furthermore, this current review may also help educators determine certain barriers that have not been resolved in campus tactics which may influence the acculturation of sojourning populations."

Articles were selected and examined with a focus on four dimensions: customer, risk, supply chain, and platform. Contradictions in these dimensions were found to result in two major obstacles to CBEC development, namely, dataset sharing and platform scalability. These obstacles prevent research on cross-border platforms from moving beyond theory-based studies. Further research needs to examine how soft computing can be used to accelerate and remodel the global trade ecosystem."

This SRS serves as a base for software development. The software needs to be developed in a syllogized software development life cycle (SDLC) stages. The SRS which denote the requirements of BP is used as input to the analysis stage from which the paradigm dependent components are to be abstracted. Hither to the components are abstracted manually with the exception of hiatuses of semi-automated methods for few of the components. The SRS is construed with reference to the specific paradigm through which the design is to be developed. Unfortunately, no complete automated methodology exists for the abstraction of all paradigm dependent components. The automated methodology eliminates the possible human errors which would have ripple effect to damage the entire software. This paper develops an innovative, unique methodology to resurrect the SRS statements as modular statements. Further develops an automated methodology for abstraction of control and data flow graphs. Further it develops an automated methodology for abstraction of useful components required for the class diagram. The class diagram emphasizes both structural and behavioral aspects. This facility is effectively used to abstract object class attributes, object methods, visibility, signature, return type etc. Information systems are developed through software projects which use the specific software requirements specification (SRS) provided for them as the base. The SRS contains details of the information system through which appropriate software can be developed. The information systems are also viewed perceptively with different pragmatics like work, work process or usecase. The usecase is one of the prime perspective views whose sum forms the information system. In this paper, an attempt is made to abstract object class, object class attributes, object methods, interrelationships between object classes and starting with/ending with actor from unformatted, unstructured SRS text. This is achieved through our own developed classing and slicing techniques to identify respectively the class structure & object methods. Then usecase is developed through the interrelationships between object methods of different classes and start with or end with the actor. The stages involve moulding the SRS, designing control flow graph for the SRS & data flow table for the SRS statements, developing appropriate classing and slicing criteria, creating actor & actors’ interface attributes table, create slicing criteria for each usecase and then slice relevant statements for each usecase. Here, we have attempted to use Weiser modified algorithm1 to abstract exact usecase. The slicing criterion is obtained through the intersection of actor's interface attributes and the referenced/defined attributes present between two consecutive actors. Attempts have been made to resolve synonyms & heteronyms present in the SRS. The correctness & completeness of the proposed methodology depends on the realization of actor & actors’ interface attributes."

This is because of frequently changing online contact networks and increasing accessibility to diverse information sources outside of the networks. Accordingly, massive user-generated content spreads through heterogeneous social networks beyond a single social platform. The main goal of this paper is to propose a model-free approach for estimating macro-level information transfer across heterogeneous populations without any assumptions on such dynamic and complex social networks. With this approach, we estimate macro-level diffusion across mainstream news (News), social networking sites (SNS), and blogs (Blog), and the estimations are compared with outcomes from our previous model-driven approach. We also analyze crowd phenomena in diffusion for News, SNS, and Blog as online social systems in terms of activity, reactivity, and heterogeneity. We find that News is the most active, SNS is the most reactive, and Blog is the most persistent, which governs time-evolving heterogeneity. Discovered crowd phenomena are interpreted with respect to our proposed approaches. The strength and directionality of influence reflect reactivity, while topic-related diffusion patterns reflect heterogeneity. We expect that this study can provide a consistent way of understanding cross-population diffusion in diverse application domains."

Drawing on coping theory, this study further investigated how the importance of peer feedback and depressed mood influence girls’ coping responses to the stress from lacking feedback. The results of structural equation modeling demonstrate that self-esteem exerts a negative effect on the importance of peer feedback and depressed mood, but the importance of peer feedback is positively associated with depressed mood. In addition, both the importance of peer feedback and depressed mood positively impact problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies. The results suggest that peer feedback has become a “KPI” of selfie-posting behaviors for teenage girls, and these girls handle the involved stress by a concomitant adoption of both types of coping."
2017,Facial expression recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks: Coping with few data and the training sample order,André Teixeira Lopes and Edilson {de Aguiar} and Alberto F. {De Souza} and Thiago Oliveira-Santos,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2016.07.026,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320316301753,,,,"Facial expression recognition has been an active research area in the past 10 years, with growing application areas including avatar animation, neuromarketing and sociable robots. The recognition of facial expressions is not an easy problem for machine learning methods, since people can vary significantly in the way they show their expressions. Even images of the same person in the same facial expression can vary in brightness, background and pose, and these variations are emphasized if considering different subjects (because of variations in shape, ethnicity among others). Although facial expression recognition is very studied in the literature, few works perform fair evaluation avoiding mixing subjects while training and testing the proposed algorithms. Hence, facial expression recognition is still a challenging problem in computer vision. In this work, we propose a simple solution for facial expression recognition that uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network and specific image pre-processing steps. Convolutional Neural Networks achieve better accuracy with big data. However, there are no publicly available datasets with sufficient data for facial expression recognition with deep architectures. Therefore, to tackle the problem, we apply some pre-processing techniques to extract only expression specific features from a face image and explore the presentation order of the samples during training. The experiments employed to evaluate our technique were carried out using three largely used public databases (CK+, JAFFE and BU-3DFE). A study of the impact of each image pre-processing operation in the accuracy rate is presented. The proposed method: achieves competitive results when compared with other facial expression recognition methods – 96.76% of accuracy in the CK+ database – it is fast to train, and it allows for real time facial expression recognition with standard computers."

We found that social distance, online contact and offline contact were mutually supportive, whereas the background variables included in the regression analysis (age, gender, religiosity, place of residence, education and income) had no effect on either of them. While the three are mutually supportive, perceived social distance and offline contacts had greater explanatory value than online contacts."

Maritime deterioration, climate change, cyberattacks, serious and organized crime, epidemics, and state-made threats are just some of the new and growing concerns affecting maritime security. The sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea has given maritime security doctrines and frameworks a new dimension. In this article, the current maritime security approaches and maritime domain or situational awareness (MDA/MSA) model examples of some countries and international organizations from different geographic regions and also the ones that are located in the maritime choke point regions where global maritime trade routes are located and also the effects of the Nord Stream Pipelines sabotages on these are examined in light of the new threats and risks. The principle result reached in this study is that countries and international structures should have a cross governmental maritime security strategy, or at least a doctrine, in order to guide their own maritime situational awareness models and identify information sharing architectures. The most important result of the sabotages on Nord Stream Pipelines for MSA models in this study is that the fastest and most cost-effective method for protecting critical infrastructure under the seas is the concept of systems such as Mothership controlled autonomous and unmanned underwater vehicles, extra large unmanned undersea vehicles and Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellites."

How the public perceives the COVID-19 vaccine is directly associated with vaccine compliance and vaccination coverage. This study takes a cultural sensitivity perspective and adopts two well-known social media platforms in the United States (Twitter) and China (Weibo) to conduct a public perception comparison around the COVID-19 vaccine. By implementing semantic network analysis, results demonstrate that the two countries' social media users overlapped in themes concerning domestic vaccination policies, priority groups, challenges from COVID-19 variants, and the global pandemic situation. However, Twitter users were prone to disclose individual vaccination experiences, express anti-vaccine attitudes. In comparison, Weibo users manifested evident deference to authorities and exhibited more positive feelings toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Those disparities were explained by the cultural characteristics' differences between the two countries. The findings provide insights into comprehending public health issues in cross-cultural contexts and illustrate the potential of utilizing social media to conduct health informatics studies and investigate public perceptions during public health crisis time."
2022,A comparison of humans and machine learning classifiers categorizing emotion from faces with different coverings,Harisu Abdullahi Shehu and Will N. Browne and Hedwig Eisenbarth,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2022.109701,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494622007505,,,,"Partial face coverings such as sunglasses and face masks unintentionally obscure facial expressions, causing a loss of accuracy when humans and computer systems attempt to categorize emotion. With the rise of soft computing techniques interacting with humans, it is important to know not just their accuracy, but also the confusion errors being made—do humans make less random/damaging errors than soft computing? We analyzed the impact of sunglasses and different face masks on the ability to categorize emotional facial expressions in humans and computer systems. Computer systems, represented by VGG19, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 deep learning algorithms, and humans assessed images of people with varying emotional facial expressions and with four different types of coverings, i.e. unmasked, with a mask covering the lower face, a partial mask with transparent mouth window, and with sunglasses. The first contribution of this work is that computer systems were found to be better classifiers (98.48%) than humans (82.72%) for faces without covering (>15% difference). This difference is due to the significantly lower accuracy in categorizing anger, disgust, and fear expressions by humans (p′s<.001). However, the most novel aspect of the work is identifying how soft computing systems make different mistakes to humans on the same data. Humans mainly confuse unclear expressions as neutral emotion, which minimizes affective effects. Conversely, soft techniques often confuse unclear expressions as other emotion categories, which could lead to opposing decisions being made, e.g. a robot categorizing a fearful user as happy. Importantly, the variation in the misclassification can be adjusted by variations in the balance of categories in the training set."

It focuses on the reading behavior of 23 trilingual participants from South Tyrol, Italy, who speak and understand Italian, German and Ladin, the latter a minority language in that area. The eyetracking data show whether all three languages displayed on informational signs are read and processed, and whether processing depends on specific influential factors dependent of the participants or presentation of the language versions. This type of eyetracking application poses several methodological issues which are discussed in the paper. The eyetracking data are triangulated with data from a speech production task and a self-assessment of language skills. The initial results, show that Ladin is preferred over German and Italian in terms of overall fixation duration, that the order of processing follows the marked position top to bottom and left to right, and that participant's language used to describe the processed signs matches that of the language with the most attention per stimulus. Concerning specific language processing strategies initial interpretations are given which must be followed up on."

In the approach proposed in this study, the dynamics of the speech signals are analyzed by examining the mean square error (MSE) surface and contour plots quantification of these groups. In general, the results show that the speech signals transit from a high dimensional chaotic state in control subjects to a low dimensional chaotic motion in Alzheimer's patients. This can be due to the decreased interaction of variables in psychological state. Moreover, it can be partially attributed to the fact that in AD the brain begins to shrink, with the number of brain nerve fibers gradually reducing."

It is associated with cultural attributes (e.g. language). When a digital game is localized for a target audience, game context and contents should be suitable for local culture that includes specific customs, traditions, and beliefs. Without the proper understanding of the specific culture of a target audience, game localization and culturalization may not be successful. Furthermore, it may lead to a failure in marketing and promoting sales. In this report, we reviewed the literature about culture and identified common cultural attributes. We also reviewed the importance of digital game localization and culturalization in digital game development. We discussed the examples of simple, partial, and full digital game localizations, including the ‘Pokémon Go’ game, “Scissors-Paper-Stone”, and commercial digital games that use cultural attributes as contents and context. Lastly, we discussed the importance of each cultural attribute and how they can be used in game localization and culturalization. The discussion in this report can provide insights into the importance of culture and cultural attributes in digital game localization and culturalization for game designers and practitioners."

They encompass various developments such as recruitment drives, market expansions, mergers, and product launches. Understanding these events is vital for businesses seeking to stay updated with market dynamics, as they provide real-time insights into a company’s trajectory. Moreover, comprehending the business events of one company can offer strategic advantages to others, facilitating informed decision-making and fostering collaboration within the business ecosystem. Extracting information about these events involves diverse structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data sources, posing challenges for traditional extraction methods. Despite the promise shown by existing openly available LLMs driven by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), they face challenges when dealing with domain-specific queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by seamlessly integrating multiple external data sources of varying structures. In our study, we demonstrate how RAG with LLM facilitates precise extraction of business events, ensuring adaptability in dynamic business environments where datasets are constantly evolving."

The Requirements Engineering for Well-Being, Aging, and Health (REWBAH) workshop gathering in 2021 focused on addressing the challenge of how Requirements Engineering (RE) knowledge and practices can be applied to the development of information systems that support and promote long-lasting, sustained, and healthier behavior and choices by individuals. An interactive discussion among subject matter experts and practitioners participating in the REWBAH’21 revolved around several questions. In a subsequent qualitative analysis, the emerging themes were arranged in the sustainable-health RE (SusHeRE) framework to describe RE processes that address both sustainability and health goals. In this vision paper, we present our framework, which includes four main SusHeRE goals defined according to the changes in RE that we deem necessary for achieving a positive contribution of RE on sustainability and health. These goals involve improved RE Techniques, Multidisciplinary Expertise, Education Agenda, and Public and Social Ecology."

These disorders include a variety of progressive disorders that result in cognitive and/or motor degradation. The present study was conducted to identify common potential targets for multi-neurodegenerative diseases. To accomplish this, we have selected six common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s disease (HD), Prion disease and Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) for identification of common regulatory target proteins. A total of sixteen common proteins were identified as target proteins by disease pathway analysis and previous studies based on their association with more than two NDs, including AD. An interaction network of each of the sixteen target proteins was then constructed against causative proteins selected from all six NDs by using the STRING 9.1 program. Pathway analysis and the protein–protein interaction network suggested that CASP-3 and CASP-8 were associated with the maximum number of selected NDs and may therefore be the most potent target proteins for treatment of multi-neurodegenerative diseases."

Informational social influence can still easily take place also by means of CMC, however normative influence seems to be more affected by the environmental characteristics. Different authors have theorized that deindividuation nullifies the effects of normative influence, but the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects theorizes that users will conform even when deindividuated, but only if social identity is made salient. The two typologies of social influence have never been studied in comparison, therefore in our work, we decided to create an online experiment to observe how the same variables affect them, and in particular how deindividuation works in both cases. The 181 experimental subjects that took part, performed 3 tasks: one aiming to elicit normative influence, and two semantic tasks created to test informational influence. Entropy has been used as a mathematical assessment of information availability. Our results show that normative influence becomes almost ineffective within CMC (1.4% of conformity) when subjects are deindividuated. Informational influence is generally more effective than normative influence within CMC (15–29% of conformity), but similarly to normative influence, it is inhibited by deindividuation."

The first experiment dealt with the ergonomic evaluation and identification of problems associated with the existing symbols. New concepts were then developed based on Ergonomic principles and users’ feedback. The second experiment focused upon testing of the new concepts on the target users. Results of Experiment 1 indicated that the mean comprehension level was 22.3% for all the existing symbols (n = 41). Low scores (on a scale of 1–10) were found for the existing symbol for ergonomic principles (mean value was 1.9 for Compatibility, 2.1 for Familiarity, and 2.0 for Standardisation). Redesigned concepts of the symbols were tested on the target users, the result indicated an improvement in comprehensibility of newly designed symbols. The mean comprehension level for 53 new/redesigned symbols was 70.2%, which included redesign of 41 orignal and inclusion of 12 new symbols. High scores (on a scale of 1–10) were received for all the new symbols for ergonomic principles (the mean value was 8.4 for Compatibility, 8.5 for Familiarity, and 8.5 for Standardisation). Findings of this study may be helpful for the researchers working in the domain of information ergonomics in space related to healthcare sector or similar areas."

Also, this paper deals with a novel effective technique for detecting the broken rotor fault and abnormal gear teeth fault of the induction motor. A precise finding of the fault characteristic parameter of motor is a new investigation hotspot in the Broken Rotor Bar fault diagnosis of induction motors. Broken Rotor Bar is one of the generally occurred faults in induction motor, which also might initiate critical motor damage to the motor if not found out in a right time. Also, gears that are popularly considered as most important components in the mechanical power conduction have received lots of concern in the area of condition monitoring over years and the current study is not obviously free from this. The experimental results and software simulation concluded that MPSO offers better optimization for both broken rotor bar and abnormal gear teeth fault."

Due to the diverse service architecture, detailed architectures & multiple interrelationships that occur in the cloud, implementation is complicated. A few other previous studies attempt to integrate the different fault tolerance frameworks and solutions suggested for the cloud environment, but some accounts occur to be constrained. This research article provides a detailed survey of the state-of-the-art research on emerging methods of fault tolerance for Cloud Computing & categorizes techniques of fault tolerance into three categories: Reactive Methods, Proactive Methods & Resilient Methods. Reactive Methods allow the system to reach a defect condition but instead attempt to get the device back up. Proactive Methods help to prevent the device from reaching a defective condition by introducing actions to minimize defects before impacting the device. On either side, newly developed Resilient Methods strive to reduce the amount of time a device takes to find from a malfunction. In the Resilient Methods context, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence played an important role in mapping the recovery period to a task to be configured. This survey offers a comprehensive and detailed description of the various faults kinds, factors, & different methods to fault tolerance used in the cloud. In light of their Basic Methods & some other specific characteristics, & also offers a Clear study of different tolerance mechanisms for failures & provides a comparative study of the structures under the article. It is noted that approaches of fault tolerance directed to checkpoint restart and replication are mainly included to address the crash faults in the cloud."

Two of the challenges with the Semantic Web technologies are the lack of multilingual support and the complexity of integrating multiple ontologies used by this technology. The objective of this paper is to present efforts that will help users who use the Arabic language to ask natural language questions and then get their semantic representation in SPARQL that allows them to be executed and get the relevant semantic results. This natural language interface makes more use of the cross-domain ontologies and hence improves the understanding of their inquiries, which is needed in some critical domains such as health and food where precise advice is essential. The approach we followed is multilingual and overcomes the limitations in the published relevant systems. With the proposed approach, users who speak Arabic can use the widely published ontologies in English without concern for the translation of their questions. The proposed approach will take care of matching the entered questions with the relevant ontologies to produce their semantic Web queries. The proposed approach has been implemented and empirically evaluated. The experimental results are promising, which will help in improving the awareness and usage of the Semantic Web by different lingual and cultural users."

Scholars have discussed the related topics in other fields. However, these studies did not specifically target the field of AI and primarily relied on correlation methods, which may not lead to a causal conclusion. Analyzing around 0.6 million AI collaborative papers between 1950 and 2019 with 872,727 authors and 9,258 affiliations, this study tests the causal effect of multiple-affiliation collaboration on the disruption in AI by using descriptive analysis and a causal inference method, i.e., the Propensity Score Matching (PSM). We propose an improved affiliation diversity indicator to measure the distribution of affiliation differences in multiple-affiliation collaboration by taking disparity into account. Our results show that affiliation diversity exerts a negative causal effect on the disruption of papers in AI: (a) The average level of AI papers with diverse affiliation types or affiliation countries of authors is less disruptive than those with a single type or country. (b) Affiliation diversity will causally reduce the disruption of papers in AI by 2.006%∼5.891%. That indicates that AI papers with high affiliation diversity are significantly less disruptive, ranging from 2.006% to 5.891%, compared to those without. We cross-validate the findings by using five comparison experiments and five other matching methods. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of multiple-affiliation collaboration on AI disruption."
2016,Protesting the Singapore government: The role of collective action frames in social media mobilization,Debbie Goh and Natalie Pang,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2015.07.008,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585315000878,,,,"This study engages collective action framing theory to examine the strategies employed by Singaporeans, rarely seen on the front lines of politics, on social media to organize a protest against the government’s immigration policy. It addresses critical and theoretical questions on the formation and dynamics of collective action frames on social media, and the implications for social movements. An analysis of 1805 posts and comments on blogs and Facebook leading up to the May 1, 2013 protest reveals that while organizers and protestors resonated in their development of diagnostic, prognostic and motivational frames, they placed different emphasis on the frames. This variable use of frames helps explain that while the protest was successful in mobilizing thousands to the outdoor site, it was not able to sustain the movement demanding immigration reform."
2020,How can wikipedia be used to support the process of automatically building multilingual domain modules? a case study.,Angel Conde and Ana Arruarte and Mikel Larrañaga and Jon A. Elorriaga,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102232,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457319313974,,,,"The goal of the research here presented is to identify which aspects of Wikipedia can be exploited to support the process of automatically building Multilingual Domain Modules from textbooks. First, we have defined a representation formalism for Multilingual Domain Modules that is essential for Technology Supported Learning Systems which aim to serve a globalized society. To our knowledge, no attempt has been made at achieving domain models that consider multiple languages. Our approach combines Multilingual Educational Ontologies with Learning Objects in different languages. Wikipedia is a valuable resource to accomplish this purpose. In this scenario, we have developed LiDom Builder, a framework that uses Wikipedia as an additional knowledge base for the automatic generation of Multilingual Domain Modules from textbooks. The framework includes domain-independent term extraction methods to identify which topics of Wikipedia are related to the domain to be learnt and, also, extracts their equivalents in other languages. In order to complete the Educational Ontology, we have defined a method to extract pedagogical relationships from Wikipedia and other general-purpose knowledge bases. From this task, we highlight the extraction of relationship that will allow the sequencing of the topics in Technology Supported Learning Systems. In addition, LiDom Builder takes advantage of the structured contents of Wikipedia to identify text fragments that can be used for educational purposes, classifies them and generates their corresponding Learning Objects. The interlanguage links between topics of Wikipedia are used to create Learning Objects in other languages."
2023,A collaborative semantic framework based on activities for the development of applications in Smart Home living labs,Cristina Rodríguez-Gallego and Fernando Díez-Muñoz and María-Luisa Martín-Ruiz and Ana-Marta Gabaldón and María Dolón-Poza and Iván Pau,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2022.10.027,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X2200351X,,,,"An essential element to improve the quality of life at home is to understand the behavior of its inhabitants and the activities they perform on a daily basis. The collection and analysis of this information in Smart Home environments poses several challenges, mainly data variability, and the management and synchronization of devices, which have limited the adoption of this kind of solutions. Researchers tend to work focused on providing solutions to specific issues and, in research environments that share infrastructure, such as living labs, it is common that previous developments of other teams are not reused. This process is suboptimal and does not allow understanding the Smart Home as a single space, but as a set of functional islands. To overcome these obstacles, a novel collaborative semantic framework is proposed for the extraction, characterization, and formalization of data to enable its reutilization and interpretation. The framework is based on the concept of activity, decomposed as a series of actions and events, and follows current trends in the domain of Activities of Daily Living and Smart Homes. A set of interoperability enablers based on JSON schemas and formalized descriptions of the domain have been proposed as the main facilitators of collaboration and the integration of elements coexisting in the Smart Home environment. The evaluation of the framework through the development of two research projects showed significant benefits, improving the overall quality of the solutions and enriching the extraction of insights through the correlated analysis of data."

The ways students perceive these skills or what kind of dispositions they have in this regard are significant. This paper provides an overview of the development of pre-service teachers' perceived 21st-century skills and dispositions. The quantitative data was collected in three phases during 2014, 2015, and 2016 at three Finnish universities. The number of respondents at each measurement point varied from 209 to 267. Data were analysed using latent growth curve modeling. The study focuses on students' perceptions of three areas related to 21st-century skills: learning skills, collaboration dispositions, and skills to use ICT. The results show that the three areas evolved in different ways. Learning skills and collaboration dispositions show up as yearly assessments that remain at the same level, with small differences among respondents, unlike skills to use ICT with bigger yearly changes. The measured areas also appear as separate entities throughout the bachelor's studies, with small or non-significant correlations. These results reveal important new perspectives on how pre-service teachers perceive 21st-century skills and how perceptions evolve during teacher education."

Mango maturity level often makes farmers confused when choosing a mango that has a good maturity. Sometimes, mango farmers still use manual methods to distinguish mango maturity, while the way that human labor is often inaccurate and different in its determination. The difference is due to the different perceptions of each person. From these problems then the need of machine sorting system on agriculture is felt important. Therefore, researchers will conduct research on mango sortation system. Mango has many types such as “Harum Manis”, “Apple”, “Gincu”, etc. In this study type of mango that will be studied is mango “Gincu” because has a good color distribution. The goal of the research is to create a system that can sort mango that ripe or unripe. The method that used to do this research is separated into few step: problem identification, algorithm development, implementation and evaluation. The system is made using C language, Computer Vision and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) so the system can detect the color of mango that has been ripe or unripe. The output of this research will be compared to related research. The final output of this research is the system can detect the ripe or unripe mango with 94% accuracy."

Stukel and Sumeet Kalia and Babak Aliarzadeh and Tao Chen and Braden O'Neill and Michelle Greiver,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2022.104034,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046422000508,,,,"Objective
To demonstrate how non-negative matrix factorization can be used to learn a temporal topic model over a large collection of primary care clinical notes, characterizing diverse COVID-19 pandemic effects on the physical/mental/social health of residents of Toronto, Canada.
Materials and Methods
The study employs a retrospective open cohort design, consisting of 382,666 primary care progress notes from 44,828 patients, 54 physicians, and 12 clinics collected 01/01/2017 through 31/12/2020. Non-negative matrix factorization uncovers a meaningful latent topical structure permeating the corpus of primary care notes. The learned latent topical basis is transformed into a multivariate time series data structure. Time series methods and plots showcase the evolution/dynamics of learned topics over the study period and allow the identification of COVID-19 pandemic effects. We perform several post-hoc checks of model robustness to increase trust that descriptive/unsupervised inferences are stable over hyper-parameter configurations and/or data perturbations.
Results
Temporal topic modelling uncovers a myriad of pandemic-related effects from the expressive clinical text data. In terms of direct effects on patient-health, topics encoding respiratory disease symptoms display altered dynamics during the pandemic year. Further, the pandemic was associated with a multitude of indirect patient-level effects on topical domains representing mental health, sleep, social and familial dynamics, measurement of vitals/labs, uptake of prevention/screening maneuvers, and referrals to medical specialists. Finally, topic models capture changes in primary care practice patterns resulting from the pandemic, including changes in EMR documentation strategies and the uptake of telemedicine.
Conclusion
Temporal topic modelling applied to a large corpus of rich primary care clinical text data, can identify a meaningful topical/thematic summarization which can provide policymakers and public health stakeholders a passive, cost-effective, technology for understanding holistic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the primary healthcare system and community/public-health."
2023,Comparison of machine learning and conventional logistic regression-based prediction models for gestational diabetes in an ethnically diverse population; the Monash GDM Machine learning model,Yitayeh Belsti and Lisa Moran and Lan Du and Aya Mousa and Kushan {De Silva} and Joanne Enticott and Helena Teede,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2023.105228,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505623002460,,,,"Background
Early identification of pregnant women at high risk of developing gestational diabetes (GDM) is desirable as effective lifestyle interventions are available to prevent GDM and to reduce associated adverse outcomes. Personalised probability of developing GDM during pregnancy can be determined using a risk prediction model. These models extend from traditional statistics to machine learning methods; however, accuracy remains sub-optimal.
Objective
We aimed to compare multiple machine learning algorithms to develop GDM risk prediction models, then to determine the optimal model for predicting GDM.
Methods
A supervised machine learning predictive analysis was performed on data from routine antenatal care at a large health service network from January 2016 to June 2021. Predictor set 1 were sourced from the existing, internationally validated Monash GDM model: GDM history, body mass index, ethnicity, age, family history of diabetes, and past poor obstetric history. New models with different predictors were developed, considering statistical principles with inclusion of more robust continuous and derivative variables. A randomly selected 80% dataset was used for model development, with 20% for validation. Performance measures, including calibration and discrimination metrics, were assessed. Decision curve analysis was performed.
Results
Upon internal validation, the machine learning and logistic regression model’s area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 71% to 93% across the different algorithms, with the best being the CatBoost Classifier (CBC). Based on the default cut-off point of 0.32, the performance of CBC on predictor set 4 was: Accuracy (85%), Precision (90%), Recall (78%), F1-score (84%), Sensitivity (81%), Specificity (90%), positive predictive value (92%), negative predictive value (78%), and Brier Score (0.39).
Conclusions
In this study, machine learning approaches achieved the best predictive performance over traditional statistical methods, increasing from 75 to 93%. The CatBoost classifier method achieved the best with the model including continuous variables."

However, to date, there is no consensus on the extent to which adolescents and emerging adults perpetrate and experience CDA. Based on the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines, the present work performed separate meta-analyses for studies involving adolescents and emerging adults. This study aims to estimate the pooled prevalence of CDA perpetration and victimization and try to explain discrepancies in the literature. In all, 69 publications (25 adolescent and 44 emerging adult studies) on CDA were identified through a systematic literature search, including 74 independent samples with a total of 62,376 participants. The results showed that the overall prevalence of CDA perpetration was 24.0% and victimization was 36.9% among adolescents, while 44.6% and 43.4% for CDA perpetration and victimization among emerging adults. Moderator analyses revealed that higher rates of CDA perpetration and victimization were found for older adolescents. In addition, control dimension had higher rates of CDA perpetration and victimization compared to direct aggression dimension among emerging adults. Finally, the assessed lifetime prevalence of CDA perpetration was higher than that assessed in the last year in emerging adults, whereas unpublished studies showed a higher prevalence of CDA victimization compared to published studies in adolescents. In sum, current evidence contributes to a better understanding of the prevalence and influencing factors for CDA among adolescents and emerging adults. Prevention and intervention programs are urgently required to reduce CDA behaviors in adolescents and emerging adults."

Recently, the most typical graph convolutional networks (GCN) has achieved excellent performance in the semi-supervised framework-based data representation learning tasks. GCN successfully generalizes traditional convolutional neural networks to encode arbitrary graphs by exploiting the graph Laplacian-based sample structure information. However, GCN only fuses the static structure information. It is difficult to guarantee that its structure information is optimal during the training process and applicable for all practical applications. To tackle the above problem, in this paper, we propose a manifold regularized dynamic graph convolutional network (MRDGCN). The proposed MRDGCN automatically updates the structure information by manifold regularization until model fitting. In particular, we build an optimization convolution layer formulation to acquire the optimal structure information. Thus, MRDGCN can automatically learn high-level sample features to improve the performance of data representation learning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we apply MRDGCN on the semi-supervised classification tasks. The extensive experiment results on human activity datasets and citation network datasets validate the performance of MRDGCN compared with GCN and other semi-supervised learning methods."

The study intervention involved synchronous text-chat across three sessions administered online over three weeks, and required pairs of majority students (n = 44) and Ethiopian students (n = 44) to work collaboratively on planning a social-cultural trip and come up with a ‘travel guide’ that satisfies the needs of the interacting students’ cultural groups (Integration). The study evaluated both short-term (one week) and long-term (six weeks) effects of the intervention on majority members’ outgroup attitudes. The study findings revealed that, compared to majority controls (n = 41), participants in the intervention condition reported a greater decrease in intergroup bias and anxiety in the short- and long-terms. A mediation effect of intergroup anxiety was also found; the intervention reduced majority members’ intergroup anxiety in the short-term which was related to reduced long-term intergroup bias. These encouraging findings highlight that carefully designed cooperative electronic-contact programs tailored to promote majority individuals’ endorsement of the Integrationist orientation, can offer an efficacious route to acculturation researchers interested in promoting this strategy, improving in turn majority members’ outgroup attitudes toward minorities."

This research aimed to shed new light on the manner in which students learn and practice hybrid work in educational settings. To this end, two educational studies were performed, for examining students practicing design thinking (DT) in hybrid mode and the development of their empathy skills during this experience. The main case study was conducted in an academic hackathon-like course, where students addressed loneliness-related challenges during four full days using a configured web platform. In a follow-up case study, the adaptability of this approach to small-scale settings of a 90-minute DT workshop was explored. The students filled in questionnaires, which examined their empathy development in three dimensions: Skill, Orientation, and Being. The findings show the benefits of the web platform and the extent to which these academic educational programs fostered empathy and innovation and highlights the challenges, opportunities, and benefits of fostering new educational programs that allow hybrid participation, involving external stakeholders, and guide the students to handle real challenges. Such hybrid academic programs can prepare students for the hybrid, multidisciplinary work reality towards developing human-centered solutions."

Decisions to apply technical or policy solutions must consider how an individual's values and moral stance influence their responses to these implementations. Our research aims to evaluate how individuals prioritise different ethical principles when making cybersecurity sensitive decisions and how much perceived choice they have when doing so. Further, we sought to use participants’ responses to cybersecurity scenarios to create profiles that describe their values and individual factors including personality. Participants (n = 193) in our study responded to five different ethically sensitive cybersecurity scenarios in random order, selecting their action in that scenario and rating and ranking of the ethical principles (i.e., Beneficence, Non-Maleficence, Justice, Autonomy, Explicability) behind that action. Using participants’ demographics, personality, values, and cyber hygiene practices, we created profiles using machine learning to predict participants’ choices and the principle of most importance to them across scenarios. Further, we found that, generalising, for our participants Autonomy was the most important ethical principle in our scenarios, followed by Justice. Our study also suggests that participants felt they had some agency in their decision making and they were able to weigh up different ethical principles."

The current field experiment investigated how emotions expressed by participants in intergroup contact sessions—in the form of a synchronous online chat program—predicted a reduction in intergroup bias. Here 102 Muslim and 103 Christian high-school students spent eight Internet sessions in either a Dual Identity Electronic(E)-Contact (DIEC) program integrating interfaith information and intergroup contact, or a Control program involving within-faith information and ingroup contact. Participants also completed pre- and post-program measures of intergroup bias. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a computerised text analysis program, we objectively analysed data from across the eight Internet sessions, and found that groups in the two conditions expressed emotions differently. That is, the DIEC chat groups used more affect and positive emotion words, and less anger and sadness words than the Control chat groups. Mediation analyses showed that anger and sadness mediated the intervention effect on T2, T3 and T4 intergroup bias. In other words, DIEC chat groups’ reduced expressions of anger and sadness were related to reduced short- and long-term intergroup bias. These findings highlight the significant role that structured Internet interactions can play in creating positive and long-lasting intergroup relations."

However, very few methods are proposed to detect joints in the human body. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid framework to detect joints automatically by using depth camera. In the proposed method, joints are categorized into two classes: implicit joints and dominant joints. Implicit joints are the joints on the torso, such as neck and shoulders. Dominant joints include elbows and knees. In the hybrid framework we proposed, a loose skeleton model is used to locate implicit joints, and data-driven method is applied to detect dominant joints. The highlight of the proposed work is that geodesic features of the human body are used to build the skeleton model and detect joints. To evaluate our work, experiments are conducted on the dataset recorded by a Microsoft Kinect and compared with state-of-art methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed work can deliver stable and accurate detection results of joints."

However, there are another studies denied this kind of relationship. In this paper, we will explore these two types of studies in two aspects. First, we will study what kind of skills or reactions that the player will earn after playing kind of games. These reactions can be explicit or implicit and positive or negative reactions such as development, improving social relationships, enhance the problem solving skills or violence, aggression, anxiety or stressful reaction. In the second part of the paper, we will address the evidences that are used by the previous studies to demonstrate the validity of their conclusions."

After sketching challenges of workplace collaboration in South Korea, we present an ethnography of a co-creation workshop at a food company. To detail how sticky notes support collaborative inquiry, we approach them as active nonhuman actors and analyze the workshop progression through the four moments of ANT's sociology of translation—problematization, intéressement, enrolment, and mobilization. We conclude that stickies enable an effective silent ideation by hushing domineering senior participants and amplifying opinions from junior and mid-career participants. Finally, implications are drawn for stickies' mediating ability in culturally specific collaborative practices."

This method is proposed by Semiotic Engineering and involves the participation of users for groupware systems, called MAC-G. By applying it as an evaluation for learning management systems in three dimensions, it proved to be appropriate although missing some categories to be more effective. The evaluation using MAC-G fleshed out some clues for changing the way teacher plans the interaction and also pointed out the need for an extension more appropriate to 3D Virtual Environments."

Inspired by this turn within museums, the exhibition FOLK adopted a multi-level co-design approach to address scientific racism and its heritage in contemporary science and society. Here we focus on the processes of collaborative curation during a series of public, pre-exhibition events and use the concepts of “knowledge pieces”, “transformation” and “correspondence” to analyse how the events became curatorially consequential. We argue that the events acted as sensitising devices for the exhibition team by bringing together ethnographic and critical design methods."

Until recently, neighbourhood classifications were traditionally census-based. This study presents a different approach in developing a community-based area classification for exploring the relationship between neighbourhood characteristics and crime through the integration of new data sources from social media with contextual variables from the traditional census. In this study, partition around medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm is used to partition 105 Leeds community areas into four distinct groups based on their crime rates. Silhouette index and adjusted rand index (ARI) were used to evaluate the validity of clusters internally and externally. The new typology developed, has revealed new insights demonstrating the relationship between social cohesion and crime rates in Leeds community areas. The new partitioned clusters also provide area-based specific information, on criminal activities that could help in policy planning for community building and better resource allocation towards reducing crime rates."

To better understand this multidimensional geography, our paper develops a new geodemographic classification for the spatial extent of Great Britain. In this model, we integrate a range of new small area measures that are drawn from multiple new forms of data including consumer purchasing data, survey and open data sources. Our analytical approach innovatively provides an integration of machine learning into a small-area estimation technique to obtain Lower Super Output Area / Data Zone estimates of Internet use, alongside a range of online engagement and consumption measures. Following the collation of a range of input measures, we implemented a more standard geodemographic framework that utilises the unsupervised clustering algorithm k-means to produce a map of the multidimensional characteristics of digital inequality for Great Britain; creating the Internet User Classification (IUC). Our outputs provide a new and nuanced understanding of the contemporary salient characteristics of digital inequality in Great Britain, which we evaluate both internally and externally within the context of preparations for the 2021 UK Census of the Population, exploring the geodemographic patterns of Census test response rates and the prevalence to complete the survey online. Our innovative work illustrates the strength of a geodemographic approach in mapping spatial patterns of digital inequality, and through the presented application concerning Census response rates and characteristics we demonstrate how the IUC can be operationalised within such settings for local intervention or benchmarking."

The primary purpose of the current empirical research is to unearth whether and how WeChat interaction could enhance overseas students’ sense of subjective well-being by concentrating on social integration, bridging relationships, and bonding relationships. Using web-based data of 228 Chinese subjects, the obtained results reveal that the time spent on WeChat significantly and directly impacts users’ subjective well-being. Additionally, the findings demonstrate that social integration, bridging relationships, bonding relationships are all significant predictors to subjective well-being. Furthermore, the perceptions of social integration and social capital could play the crucial mediating roles in the connection between WeChat use and the dependent variable of subjective well-being. Therefore, these outcomes may shed light on a more nuanced comprehending of the influence of the new social media interaction on sojourner’s social adaption and overall life quality in the digital age."

However, precisely how trust and trust-based management strategy influence team performance have remained elusive. This paper develops a method of trust-based team management to understand which managerial strategy has what impact on performance, and to discern decision alternatives. The method concentrates on providing a dynamic model of trust considering trust relationship initialization, updating trust based on experience and determining what trust should have an effect on. The model is used to explain how the trust-based management strategy caused the team to evolve in particular directions rather than others. Some prescriptions are put forward for the proper management of team. We argue that a human-machine collaborative team is a multi-agent system and team members are autonomous agents. Three computational experiments are conducted under different internal and external conditions for the artificial team, yielding the following results. (1) Under different difficulty of tasks, trust may produce either positive or negative effect on performance. (2) Trust-based management strategy dose has effect on performance under difficult task. (3) The results demonstrate the different effect of three trust-based management strategies on performance. The study method and findings presented herein are appropriate for other studies focusing on dynamic effects on team, laying the foundations for new ideas for studying team building and team development."

This is especially the case in emergency situations where people in the scene create and share on-the-spot information about the incident in real time. However, despite the proven importance of such platforms, finding event-related information from the real-time feeds of thousands of tweets is a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel method for detecting event-specific and informative tweets that are likely to be beneficial for emergency response. The method investigates a sample dataset of tweets which was collected during a storm event passing over a specific area. The sample is manually labelled by three emergency management experts who annotated the sample dataset to obtain the ground truth through identification of the event-related tweets. A selected number of representative event-related tweets are used to extract the common patterns and to define event related term-classes based on term frequency analysis. The term-classes are used to evaluate the event relatedness of a sample dataset through a relationship scoring process. Consequently, each sample tweet is given an event-relatedness score which indicates how related a tweet is to the storm event. The results are compared with the ground truth to determine the cut-off relatedness score and to evaluate the performance of the method. The results of the evaluation indicate that the proposed method is able to detect event-related tweets with about 87% accuracy in a timely manner."

The immune algorithm is inspired by the biological immune system that has been proven to be effective in many practical multiobjective optimization problems, with efficient convergence and search efficiency. In this paper, a novel multiobjective multifactorial immune algorithm is proposed with a novel information transfer method to solve multiobjective multitask optimization problems. For each task, information advantageous for this task will be transferred from the others to accelerate convergence through the proposed information transfer method. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary multitasking algorithms and the classic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results on the classical multiobjective multitask and the multiobjective many-task test suites demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides very promising performances."

It follows a content and social network analysis approach to investigate the interplay of language and political partisanship in social media use, among Twitter users in Malaysia. In the period leading up to the 2013 elections, Twitter posts collected under the hashtag #GE13 reveal that communities that post in English versus the Malay language, differ in how they use Twitter and with whom they interact. As compared to English users, Malay users are more likely to seek political information and express their political opinion. In online discussions, we observe language-based homophily within the English and Malay language communities, but there are some cross-cutting interactions between opposing political communities. We discuss the implications of our findings for the political use of new communication technologies in multi-ethnic and multilingual societies."

Despite the role of culture in shaping attitudes and motivations, most of the extensive research literature on the determinants and patterns of social media use has focused on psychological and social factors. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap by investigating the role of cultural values in perceptions of privacy, trust and motivations for using Facebook among young Palestinians in Israel. We relied on Hall’s concept of high and low communication contexts and three of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions: collectivism, power distance and uncertainty avoidance. Data from a survey of Arab high school students (N=567) established that variations in the adoption of cultural values are associated with the motivation for using Facebook through their effect on trust and on privacy concerns. We discuss the findings and their implications."

Within this chapter, the fundamental concepts of cognitive science are explored, encompassing the understanding of the brain, sensory motor information, language, and linguistics. This exploration encompasses the concepts of psycholinguistics and creative linguistics. Additionally, the chapter delves into the theory of information processing and the notion of short-term memory (STM). Moreover, the chapter presents case studies that revolve around the aforementioned topics of brain and sensory motor information, language and linguistic knowledge, information processing, and the concept of STM."

In this study, we adopted basic needs theory to further explore the relationship between these two forms of participation by adopting online service recovery using tourism applications (apps) as the research context. The results indicate that two subdimensions of MCP (physical and mental participation) promote customers’ perceived autonomy, competence, and relatedness, resulting in higher online post-recovery satisfaction and VCP intentions (e.g., helping others and recommending). However, the third subdimension of MCP (emotional participation) only positively affects perceived competence. Furthermore, customer-oriented tourism apps can enhance the positive effects of physical and mental participation in terms of satisfying basic needs."

A narrative inquiry was conducted with 22 older Chinese migrants (aged 67 on average) who participated in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, yielding 269 pages of the transcripts and notes for analysis. Older Chinese migrants’ information behaviors were demonstrated as a five-stage information journey model driven by information seeking for migration, involving the identification of primary concerns of living, the orientation of the new setting and local information landscapes, response to the new information reality, and reconstruction of information landscapes across the transitional phases of understanding, negotiating, and resolving. The findings expand the knowledgebase on information behavior in the significant transition of late-life migration and a life event-oriented information journey. Practical implications are provided for information interventions and support that may be useful at different stages of information journey in transition."

Influences on participant experience in crowds identified by the focus groups and observations included: physical design of crowd space and facilities (layout, queuing strategies), crowd movement (monitoring capacity, pedestrian flow), communication and information (signage, wayfinding), comfort and welfare (provision of facilities, environmental comfort), and public order. It was found that important aspects affecting participant experience are often not considered systematically in the planning of events or crowd situations. The findings point to human factors aspects of crowds being overlooked, with the experiences of participants often poor."

Modern code reviews are supported by tools to enhance developers’ interactions allowing contributors to submit their opinions for each committed change in form of comments. Although the comments are aimed at discussing potential technical issues, the text might enclose harmful sentiments that could erode the benefits of suggested changes.
Objective
In this paper, we study empirically the impact of sentiment embodied within developers’ comments on the time and outcome of the code review process.
Method
Based on historical data of four long-lived Open Source Software (OSS) projects from a code review system we investigate whether perceived sentiments have any impact on the interval time of code changes acceptance.
Results
We found that (1) contributors frequently express positive and negative sentiments during code review activities; (2) the expressed sentiments differ among the contributors depending on their position within the social network of the reviewers (e.g., core vs peripheral contributors); (3) the sentiments expressed by contributors tend to be neutral as they progress from the status of newcomer in an OSS project to the status of core team contributors; (4) the reviews with negative comments on average took more time to complete than the reviews with positive/neutral comments, and (5) the reviews with controversial comments took significantly longer time in one project.
Conclusion
Through this work, we provide evidences that text-based sentiments have an impact on the duration of the code review process as well as the acceptance or rejection of the suggested changes."

Results show that ICTs have implied qualitative changes in family functioning, creating new interaction scenarios and rearranging current family relational patterns. Some gaps in the literature are pointed out, such as the difference operationalization of variables and the use of non-standard instruments in the studies. Suggestions are made for clinical interventions and future research in this domain."

Considering datasets differing in terms of volume of data and observation window size, our results indicate that spatio-temporal eating and drinking habits of users voluntarily expressed in LBSNs has the potential to explain cultural habits of the users. From this, we propose a methodology to identify cultural boundaries and similarities across populations at different scales, e.g., countries, cities, or neighborhoods. This methodology is extensively evaluated in several aspects. For instance, by proposing some variations of it disregarding some of the considered dimensions, as well as analyzing the results using datasets from different periods and window of observation. The results indicate that our proposed methodology is a promising approach for automatic cultural habits separation, which could enable new urban services."

A binary pairwise procedure within the framework of the conjoint analysis was employed to assess the examinees’ preferences. The experimental stimuli differed in the brand name location in relation to the product image (left and right hand side), background colors used (grey and pink), and the typography applied to the brand name (big and compact text versus small with the increased interletter spacing). The main results showed significant effects of brand name location and typography along with significant interactions concerned with the background package color. Generally, males preferred grey variants while females – pink. These results analyzed along with the conjoint analysis outcomes surprisingly show that the background color was the main factor influencing males’ preferences while for women it was the least important issue. The cluster analysis results demonstrated significant interpersonal discrepancies and identified three, similar in number, groups sharing common preference structures."
2021,Cognitive Evaluation of Machine Learning Agents,Suvarna Kadam and Vinay Vaidya,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogsys.2020.11.003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041720300978,,,,"Advances in applying statistical Machine Learning (ML) led to several claims of human-level or near-human performance in tasks such as image classification & speech recognition. Such claims are unscientific primarily for two reasons, (1) They incorrectly enforce the notion that task-specific performance can be treated as manifestation of General Intelligence and (2) They are not verifiable as currently there is no set benchmark for measuring human-like cognition in a machine learning agent. Moreover, ML agent’s performance is influenced by knowledge ingested in it by its human designers. Therefore, agent’s performance may not necessarily reflect its true cognition. In this paper, we propose a framework that draws parallels from human cognition to measure machine’s cognition. Human cognitive learning is quite well studied in developmental psychology with frameworks and metrics in place to measure actual learning. To either believe or refute the claims of human-level performance of machine learning agent, we need scientific methodology to measure its cognition. Our framework formalizes incremental implementation of human-like cognitive processes in ML agents with an implicit goal to measure it. The framework offers guiding principles for measuring, (1) Task-specific machine cognition and (2) General machine cognition that spans across tasks. The framework also provides guidelines for building domain-specific task taxonomies to cognitively profile tasks. We demonstrate application of the framework with a case study where two ML agents that perform Vision and NLP tasks are cognitively evaluated."

Rawat and Kayhan Zrar Ghafoor,"This chapter examines the cybersecurity and privacy of the twin notions of smart transportation and intelligent transportation systems with a focus on the role of personal automobiles. Smart transportation encompasses the individual and joint capabilities of connected cars, or more generally, vehicles, and so comprises the internal workings of autonomous vehicles and the complex interdependencies introduced by vehicle-to-vehicle communications. An intelligent transportation system introduces smart technology to civil transportation infrastructure, and the connected car further creates the opportunity for vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. We identify threats and attacks enabled by smart transportation and intelligent transportation systems, and survey methods for providing security and privacy."
2016,A Health Surveillance Software Framework to deliver information on preventive healthcare strategies,Alessandra Alaniz Macedo and Juliana Tarossi Pollettini and José Augusto Baranauskas and Julia Carmona Almeida Chaves,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2016.06.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046416300454,,,,"A software framework can reduce costs related to the development of an application because it allows developers to reuse both design and code. Recently, companies and research groups have announced that they have been employing health software frameworks. This paper presents the design, proof-of-concept implementations and experimentation of the Health Surveillance Software Framework (HSSF). The HSSF is a framework that tackles the demand for the recommendation of surveillance information aiming at supporting preventive healthcare strategies. Examples of such strategies are the automatic recommendation of surveillance levels to patients in need of healthcare and the automatic recommendation of scientific literature that elucidates epigenetic problems related to patients. HSSF was created from two systems we developed in our previous work on health surveillance systems: the Automatic-SL and CISS systems. The Automatic-SL system aims to assist healthcare professionals in making decisions and in identifying children with developmental problems. The CISS service associates genetic and epigenetic risk factors related to chronic diseases with patient’s clinical records. Towards evaluating the HSSF framework, two new systems, CISS+ and CISS-SW, were created by means of abstractions and instantiations of the framework (design and code). We show that HSSF supported the development of the two new systems given that they both recommend scientific papers using medical records as queries even though they exploit different computational technologies. In an experiment using simulated patients’ medical records, we show that CISS, CISS+, and CISS-SW systems recommended more closely related and somewhat related documents than Google, Google Scholar and PubMed. Considering recall and precision measures, CISS+ surpasses CISS-SW in terms of precision."
2016,How to satisfy citizens? Using mobile government to reengineer fair government processes,Zhen-Jiao Chen and Douglas Vogel and Zhao-Hua Wang,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2015.11.005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923615002146,,,,"This paper examines how mobile and wireless technology (MWT) characteristics affect user satisfaction in the mGovernment field to which mGovernment literature thus far has paid little attention. Specifically, we identify seven MWT functions of mGovernment and explore the underlying process through which the seven MWT functions affect user satisfaction. By integrating the task-technology fit perspective and theory of procedural fairness, we develop a research model to demonstrate that the seven MWT functions of mGovernment reshape three characteristics of fair decision procedures and increase the procedural fairness of governmental services, which, in turn, improve user satisfaction. A total of 449 experienced users in China responded to a survey. The results indicate that 1) two time-critical functions of mGovernment improve transparency, 2) a location-sensitive function and a mobile multimedia function promote information accuracy and 3) three personal control functions increase voice opportunity. Further, the three fair procedural characteristics (i.e., transparency, information accuracy and voice) increase procedural fairness of governmental services, which, in turn, increases user satisfaction. This study results in a theoretical contribution to e/mGovernment and mobile service literature by explaining “which” and “how” MWT functions affect user satisfaction. Moreover, it applies and complements theory of procedural fairness in the context of mGovernment. This study also suggests guidelines for government agencies and system developers on selecting a suitable portfolio of MWT functions to fit government's various task needs and to improve user satisfaction."

In this work, we i) proposed a convolutional N-gram BiLSTM (CoNBiLSTM) word embedding which represents a word with semantic and contextual information in short and long distance periods; ii) applied CoNBiLSTM word embedding for predicting the type of a comment, its polarity sentiment (positive, neutral or negative) and whether the sentiment is directed toward the product or video; iii) evaluated the efficiency of our model on the SenTube dataset, which contains comments from two domains (i.e. automobile, tablet) and two languages (i.e. English, Italian). According to the experimental results, CoNBiLSTM generally outperforms the approach using SVM with shallow syntactic structures (STRUCT) – the current state-of-the-art sentiment analysis on the SenTube dataset. In addition, our model achieves more robustness across domains than the STRUCT (e.g. 7.47% of the difference in performance between the two domains for our model vs. 18.8% for the STRUCT)"
2018,Così fan tutte: A better approach than the right to be forgotten,Martha Garcia-Murillo and Ian MacInnes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2017.12.003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308596117303452,,,,"In this article, we argue in favor of a macro-societal approach to protect people from the potential harms of personal information online. In the tension between information and privacy, “the right to be forgotten” is not an appropriate solution. Such a micro, individual-based answer puts the burden of protection on each person instead of on external entities that can abuse such knowledge. The personal responsibility to delete personal data is challenging because of the leakage of data that happens through the connections we have with others, many of whom do not share the same privacy preferences. We show that effective deletion is almost impossible (the eternity effect), and is unfair due to the resource burden it entails when users try to achieve it, while at the same time ensuring the potential benefits we can derive in the future from having personal information online. In addition, deletion requests can negatively affect other people who are in the same location and time frame and may not want to have their information deleted. Collectively, we argue also that society is worse off because these circumstances lead people to construct sanitized personas while perpetuating a culture of distrust. Given that the harm is real, we describe technology, societal norms, and the implementation of an anti-discrimination directive for the right to a personal life, and we provide evidence on how anti-discrimination efforts in the past have succeeded when legislation leads to the development of infrastructures that help to enforce them. The dissemination of personal information through public sites and social media is, as Mozart suggested in Cosi fan tutte, gradually educating humanity about human weaknesses."

The field of soft biometrics was originally aimed to augment the recognition process by fusion of metrics that were sufficient to discriminate populations rather than individuals. This was later refined to use measures that could be used to discriminate individuals, especially using descriptions that can be perceived using human vision and in surveillance imagery. A further branch of this new field concerns approaches to estimate soft biometrics, either using conventional biometrics approaches or just from images alone. These three strands combine to form what is now known as soft biometrics. We survey the achievements that have been made in recognition by and in estimation of these parameters, describing how these approaches can be used and where they might lead to. The approaches lead to a new type of recognition, and one similar to Bertillonage which is one of the earliest approaches to human identification."

We start by explaining how to build iterative design and testing into the survey development cycle. We discuss the three primary types of testing that can be conducted depending on the goals of the study: exploratory testing, assessment testing, and verification testing. We then provide guidance on what aspects of a survey or survey design can be tested from a survey concept to a wireframe to an early interactive prototype to a finished product. We include key considerations for integrating testing on mobile devices into the process as well. We conclude the chapter by introducing the concept of the usability testing continuum that explains what situations require more intensive usability testing with repeated rounds or more participants and what situations require less testing."

In this paper we present exploratory research to provide such support to an indigenous association in the Amazon jungle. To address issues of multi-culturalism, we used a creative choice of methods, which included elements of boundary critique, the Viable System Model, rich pictures and social cartography research. We explore the possibilities that this mixed methods approach to COR offers to clarify the core dilemmas and paradoxes of self-governance for sustainability that such communities are facing. The analysis is done through VSM mapping of the community, at different levels and scales of organisation. Our analysis reveals key paradoxes and dilemmas of self-governance, which is helping them to collectively decide on action paths and their needs to (re) develop certain adaptive capabilities. In particular, we show that loss of power from traditional (spiritual) authorities, and loss of rituals and other cooperative practices have negatively affected indigenous ways of implementing life plans and respecting sustainability principles. This research contributes to COR, in presenting an innovative application of the VSM in an indigenous community, supported by expert facilitation, as the basis for reflecting on their self- governance challenges and acting upon them. It takes into account a more critical and ethnographic approach to research, capable of better dealing with the variety of a multi-cultural context."

The spoken language is characterised as a number of dialects used in everyday communication as well as informal writing. In this paper, we highlight the lexical relation between the MSA and Dialectal Arabic (DA) in more than one Arabic region. We conduct a computational cross dialectal lexical distance study to measure the similarities and differences between dialects and the MSA. We exploit several methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) like Vector Space Model (VSM), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Hellinger Distance (HD), and apply them on different Arabic dialectal corpora. We measure the overlap among all the dialects and compute the frequencies of the most frequent words in every dialect. The results are informative and indicate that Levantine dialects are very similar to each other and furthermore, that Palestinian appears to be the closest to MSA."

A teacher invited her students to read Monster (Myers, 1999), about an African-American young male who is incarcerated and waiting for trial. Afterwards, students were to create multimodal texts on iPads and post them as Vine videos on Google+. One group of three white students responded by painting a white male in blackface to match the face on the book cover. After seeing their video, Shelly explained that she was horrified at the blackface specter, but pleased to see students finally engaged in a classroom activity; however, the blackface created a pedagogical dilemma for her. This chapter explores the emotional, political, and cultural valences of Shelly’s possible options for responding to a twenty-first century blackface incident."

Successful projects need to effectively engage project customers and the key question becomes how to adequately engage project customers from foreign cultural backgrounds. This paper presents the preliminary results of a literature review in cross-cultural project customer integration. The guiding question for the review is: Which success factors can be identified in scientific literature for the cross-cultural integration of customers in projects. The paper introduces the topic and shortly lays out the necessary definitions before presenting the reviewed literature that is relevant to the review question. The literature is categorized and analyzed on abstract and findings level. The preliminary analysis reveals that the cross-cultural integration of project customers is not well researched and that further investigation in these areas is necessary. Future research is going to deepen the analysis of the presented studies. The aim is to lay the groundwork for further empirical research into success factors for customer integration in intercultural projects.

However, the task of emotion classification presents notable challenges primarily due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of emotions, encompassing varying cultural and individual interpretations. Numerous methodologies have been employed to address the complexities associated with facial emotion classification. Notably, contemporary techniques such as those that consider emotion-relevant features (e.g. mouth, eyes) have demonstrated a certain degree of success in comparison to alternative approaches (e.g. the widely employed end-to-end deep networks), which consider all pixel information in an image with equal importance. Nonetheless, a comprehensive set of guidelines evaluating not only the strengths, but also the weaknesses of deep networks remains absent. These approaches are vulnerable to even minor alterations in images, regardless of their relevance to emotion classification, e.g. a change in the foreground color of the image can reduce the accuracy of these methods by a significant amount. This results in a fragmented field, ultimately missing opportunities to enhance performance for emerging real-world applications. Therefore to address this issue, this paper offers a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art datasets and research, providing insights into different techniques and their unique contributions to emotion categorization. We also thoroughly analyze current challenges and issues, laying the groundwork for promising future research directions. Our review reveals the significance of considering contemporary methods, particularly in contrast to widely used deep networks, and their potential to enhance performance and application success."

The present study aims to identify how daily stand-up meetings are conducted and what the attitudes towards them are. A grounded theory study with 12 software teams in three companies in Malaysia, Norway, Poland and the United Kingdom was conducted. We interviewed 60 people, observed 79 daily stand-up meetings and collected supplementary data. The factors that contributed the most to a positive attitude towards the daily stand-up meeting were information sharing with the team and the opportunity to discuss and solve problems. The factors that contributed the most to a negative attitude were status reporting to the manager and that the frequency of the meeting was perceived to be too high and the duration too long. Based on our results, we developed a grounded theory of daily stand-up meetings and proposed empirically based recommendations and guidelines on how to organize them. Organizations should be aware of the factors that may affect the attitude towards daily stand-up meetings and should consider our recommendations and guidelines to make this agile practice as valuable as possible."

China has many mature experiences in transforming villages in cities, but few cases are based on cultural industries. Dafen Village in Shenzhen, a young city committed to transforming itself into an international art district through culture-orientated urban regeneration, is an exception. The transformation of villages in cities usually involves the reconstruction of old cities, the re-planning of urban landscapes and their architectural functions, to whose designs curatorial concepts and practices are indispensable. This dissertation adopts empirical analyses to examine the feasibility problems that Dafen Village has encountered in its transformation and conducts a comparative study of similar cases in China and other countries to explore transferable experience and solutions. Discussions focus on the profound role of curatorial ideas on the artistic and cultural innovations and operations in the transformation. The study concludes with an optimistic forecast of Dafen Village's new urban form after its urban regeneration."

This skill enables anticipation and increases the quality of interactions between humans. Within the context of engagement, non-verbal signals are used to communicate the intention of starting the interaction with a partner. In this paper, we investigated methods to detect these signals in order to allow a robot to know when it is about to be addressed. Originality of our approach resides in taking inspiration from social and cognitive sciences to perform our perception task. We investigate meaningful features, i.e. human readable features, and elicit which of these are important for recognizing someone’s intention of starting an interaction. Classically, spatial information like the human position and speed, the human–robot distance are used to detect the engagement. Our approach integrates multimodal features gathered using a companion robot equipped with a Kinect. The evaluation on our corpus collected in spontaneous conditions highlights its robustness and validates the use of such a technique in a real environment. Experimental validation shows that multimodal features set gives better precision and recall than using only spatial and speed features. We also demonstrate that 7 selected features are sufficient to provide a good starting engagement detection score. In our last investigation, we show that among our full 99 features set, the space reduction is not a solved task. This result opens new researches perspectives on multimodal engagement detection."

This study aims to reduce the identified gap by identifying the main barriers as well as analyzing their impact on the functioning of virtual teams. The study used analysis of the literature, TISM and MICMAC models, and research among experts. The results indicate key barriers, that are plan of work and collaboration among team members."

Traditional P2P file sharing systems focus on performance and scalability, disregarding any privacy or legal issues that may arise from their use. Lacking alternatives, and unaware of the privacy issues that arise from relaying traffic of insecure applications, users have adopted anonymity systems for P2P file sharing. This work aims at hiding user content interests from malicious peers through plausible deniability. The Mistrustful P2P model is built on the concept of mistrusting all the entities participating in the P2P network, hence its name. It provides a deterministic and configurable privacy protection that relies on cover content downloads to hide user content interests, has no trust requirements, and introduces several mechanisms to prevent user legal liability and reduce network overhead while enabling timely content downloads. We extend previous work on the Mistrustful P2P model by discussing its legal and ethical framework, assessing its feasibility for more use cases, providing a security analysis, comparing it against a traditional P2P file sharing model, and further defining and improving its main mechanisms."

The satisfaction level is a unique parameter that has not previously been applied in this field. This study focuses on the stochastic model because of its ability to handle uncertainty in the parameters of the optimization model. Real data are utilized and applied in this research. Three types of universities are investigated including medical/doctoral universities, comprehensive universities, and primarily undergraduate universities. According to the results, there is some room for improvement of the efficiency in Ontario universities. Furthermore, the results of this study show that the selection of inputs and outputs plays a crucial role in determining the ranks of universities using DEA. The results also are discussed with details for each category. For instance, increasing the number of publications is a prominent factor to rise the efficiency scores of undergraduate universities."

From the understated elegance of Japanese architecture to overwrought European Gothic structures, design is as much an expression of culture as it is of time and place. But, for all of its explosive variety, is there an actual universal sense of design? Do humans use essentially the same rules, only with different purposes and sensibilities? Our cognition and intellectual prowess is remarkably similar across cultures, so why are there so many variations on such disparate themes? The essential mechanisms of our mind that make us closer to each other are also the ones that make us closer to the laws of the universe: geometry, patterns, and language. Yet each one of these can be used in a different manner depending on the dominating preferences and tastes of our surroundings. This chapter proposes to analyse these very differences, be it in the input we provide the systems we interact with–or the output."

The two most important bibliographic databases, Web of Science and Scopus, each provide a journal classification system. However, no study has systematically investigated the accuracy of these classification systems. To examine and compare the accuracy of journal classification systems, we define two criteria on the basis of direct citation relations between journals and categories. We use Criterion I to select journals that have weak connections with their assigned categories, and we use Criterion II to identify journals that are not assigned to categories with which they have strong connections. If a journal satisfies either of the two criteria, we conclude that its assignment to categories may be questionable. Accordingly, we identify all journals with questionable classifications in Web of Science and Scopus. Furthermore, we perform a more in-depth analysis for the field of Library and Information Science to assess whether our proposed criteria are appropriate and whether they yield meaningful results. It turns out that according to our citation-based criteria Web of Science performs significantly better than Scopus in terms of the accuracy of its journal classification system."

This paper constructs an online data-driven quantitative brand image assessment method using the classic brand image theory as a conceptual model. The method is organized as follows. First, with domain expert knowledge and deep learning, this paper constructs a task ontology to clearly describe the brand image constituent content, constituent relationship, properties, and property values. Then, using the task ontology as a priori knowledge, we identify the content of brand associations from User-generated Content (UGC) and Firm-generated content (FGC), respectively, and calculate the associations’ favorability, strength and uniqueness; classify brand associations into three categories: functional, experiential, and symbolic to achieve a dual-perspectives (consumer perceptions & corporate claims) brand image assessment. Finally, this study compares the dual-perspective brand images from the components and benefits to construct a brand image communication and maintenance strategy. The development and validation of the methodology take the Chinese New Energy Vehicle (NEV) market as the analysis object. The proposed dual-perspective brand image quantitative assessment model is a new development of brand image evaluation and maintenance theoretical method in the digital era. It is also a practical tool for brand management in enterprises."

Tettegah and Dorothy L. Espelage,"Digital empathy is a new concept aiming to highlight social, emotional, and cognitive practices in a collaborative video production as part of a digital and media literacy class. The structured five stages of video production (screenplay writing, preproduction, production, postproduction, and screening) enhance six distinctive empathy phenomena (empathic concern, cognitive empathy, projective empathy, affective empathy, psychological empathy, and aesthetic empathy). Together as the process comes to an end, most of the students experience higher levels of empathy. This chapter describes the theoretical background and provides the connection between each stage of production and the empathy phenomena. Digital empathy as a new concept calls for further research to explore these connections and better understand how to foster social, emotional, and cognitive skills with digital devices in the classroom."
2025,Assessing the (severity of) impacts on fundamental rights,Gianclaudio Malgieri and Cristiana Santos,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2025.106113,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364925000081,,,,"""Risk to fundamental rights,"", ""impact on fundamental rights"", ""harm to fundamental rights"" and ""non-material damages"" are all terms referring to similar problems, though inherently ambiguous and very problematic, especially in the age of AI-based technologies and digital platforms. Traditionally, legal and social sciences have two different approaches to analysing the impacts on fundamental rights: the rights-based approach and the risk of harm-based approach to fundamental rights. The rights-based approach is binary, focusing on whether rights and obligations are respected or violated. In contrast, a harm-based approach focuses on the anticipation of undesired events and measuring their likelihood and severity. However, focusing solely on ""harms'' or ""damages'' is reductionist, while existing impact assessment models often use vague terms like ""gravity"", ""intensity,"" and ""magnitude"", which do not effectively help measure interferences with fundamental rights. Without operational criteria to measure these risks, most EU digital strategies demanding impact and risk assessments fail. Examples include the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) in the GDPR, Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments (FRIA) in the AI Act, and systemic risk assessments in the Digital Services Act (DSA). We posit that interferences with fundamental rights are seen as a spectrum that ranges from social contacts to violations, and these interferences can and should be measured. Thus, this article proposes a rights-based approach, combining it with elements from the harm approach and proposes an actionable parameter-based framework (also based on social meaning theories and social perception methodologies) to assess impacts on fundamental rights. The proposed multi-metric approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of the severity of impacts on fundamental rights within EU law, particularly in GDPR, DSA, and AI Act. This approach aims to inform policymaking, prioritise high-risk scenarios and propose mitigation measures in digital markets. This is especially important for detecting and addressing human vulnerabilities in interactions with digital technologies."

This paper contributes to how structural, ideological and contextual factors affect tie formation between parliamentarians’ Twitter networks. The study focuses on Finland, where over 80 percent of parliamentarians are using the platform. For empirical analysis, we first extracted parliamentarians’ followee network connections from their Twitter accounts (36 294 nodes and 113 108 edges) and combined it with data from a national voting advice application, which includes information regarding parliamentarians' societal position and opinions regarding social, cultural and economic issues. According to the explanatory analysis, we found that connections between parliamentarians and the share of mutual followees are clearly based on matching values, similar background and shared contextual factors. Additionally, we found that shared context had strong confounding effects on the function of value homophily in relations and shared networks between Finnish parliamentarians."

Meiselman,"This chapter focuses on the complexities and contexts of a proper meal by analyzing its contents, ingredients, and commensality. The starting point is that meals matter because in addition to offering substance, meals are symbols, rituals, arenas for commensality, and markers of both similarities and differences. Everyday patterns of eating are embedded and intertwined in the cultural, social, and economic contexts and conditions of societies. First, the chapter introduces various definitions of proper meals. Second, based on Nordic data, it analyzes what elements are regarded as essential in a proper meal before exploring why sharing a meal with other people is important. Finally, the chapter ponders how the idea of properness of eating is changing."

DinoPlates simulates and lets learners control Earth’s geological processes and search for dinosaur fossils to support playful learning of Earth science concepts. We contend that the learners transformed classroom social practices during gameplay, which exhibited their playful engagement by shaping their own activities in the classroom. Findings indicate that different pairs playing the game altered the intended goals and outcomes of the game; these instances are often accompanied by humour and laughter, and transformed the social structure and solidarity of the classroom. We discuss the opportunities that the design of DinoPlates afforded for emergent social practices in gameplay and the roles that learners’ laughter and humour played in transforming their practices."
2019,Ontology-based representation and reasoning about precise and imprecise temporal data: A fuzzy-based view,Fatma Ghorbel and Fayçal Hamdi and Elisabeth Métais and Nebrasse Ellouze and Faïez Gargouri,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.datak.2019.101719,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X19300382,,,,"Temporal representation and reasoning are important facets in the design of many Semantic Web applications. Several approaches exist to represent and reason about precise temporal data in ontology. However, most of them handle only time intervals and associated qualitative relations. Besides, to the best of our knowledge, there is no approach devoted to handle imprecise temporal data (e.g., “late 1970s”). In this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach for representing and reasoning about precise and imprecise temporal data. Quantitative temporal data (i.e., time intervals and points) and qualitative ones (i.e., relations between time intervals, relations between a time interval and a time point and relations between time points) are taken into consideration. Our approach is three folds: (i) extending the 4D-fluents approach with new crisp and fuzzy components, to represent precise and imprecise temporal data, (ii) extending the Allen’s interval algebra to enable reasoning about precise and imprecise temporal data, and (iii) creating a Fuzzy-OWL 2 ontology TimeOnto that, based on the extended Allen’s interval algebra, instantiates our 4D-fluents-based representation. The extension that we propose for the Allen’s interval algebra handles precise and imprecise time intervals. Indeed, it enables expressing precise (e.g., “before”) and imprecise (e.g., “just before”) temporal relations. Compared to related work, our imprecise relations are personalized, in the sense that they are not limited to a defined set of interval relations and their meanings are determined by the domain expert. For instance, the classic Allen’s relation “Before” may be generalized in 5 imprecise relations, where “Before(1)” means “just before” and gradually the time gap between the two intervals increases until “Before(5)” which means “very long before”. To enable this representation, we propose an extension of the Vilain and Kautz’s point algebra and redefined the Allen’s relations by means of this extended algebra. We show in this paper that, unlike most related work, the resulting relations preserve many of the desirable properties of the Allen’s interval algebra. The definitions of the resulting interval relations are adapted to allow relating a time interval and a time point, and two time points, where time intervals and points maybe both precise or both imprecise. These relations can be used for temporal reasoning by means of four transitivity tables. Finally, we describe a prototype based on “TimeOnto” that infers new relations using a set of SWRL and fuzzy IF-THEN rules. This prototype was integrated in an ontology-based memory prosthesis for Alzheimer’s patients."

A first challenge is elaborating a framework that distinguishes between the co-elaboration of knowledge types (cognitive, linguistic, social, technological…), yet shows their connections. A second challenge is distinguishing co-elaboration of knowledge from self and social regulation of knowledge elaboration. Knowing what knowledge you are regulating may facilitate knowledge regulation. Meeting the first challenge allows us to combine research from different traditions in order to broaden understanding. Meeting the second helps determine how to support the regulation of knowledge elaboration. As a first step towards meeting these challenges, we propose 1) the logical space of knowledge elaboration and its regulation and 2) a multi-theoretical, interdisciplinary model called Multi-grain collaborative knowledge construction that concerns how individuals and groups co-elaborate knowledge during group interactions. We instantiate this model with two illustrations (physics learning and collaborative game learning) and their corresponding logical spaces of elaboration and regulation. Results reveal how knowledge regulation occurs through action and not just verbalization, that regulation interventions are multifunctional, that meta knowledge about learning can help regulation, that knowledge acquired during development is more difficult to regulate. A roadmap is proposed for furthering the distinction between knowledge elaboration and regulation."

Based on an extensive literature review, seven governance criteria were identified: credibility and non-profit orientation, regular information flow and transparency, level of institutionalization, frequency of leadership turnover, internal and external stakeholder relations, annual budget, and ideological or religious motivation. In addition, five innovative organizational models were selected as strategic alternatives: continuous learning organization, technology-oriented policy development, income diversification, pluralistic governance, and transformational leadership. The empirical data were gathered through interviews with 16 experts from academia, civil society, and public institutions in Türkiye. To address the complexity and uncertainty of decision-making processes, a hybrid type-2 neutrosophic number (T2NN) multi-criteria decision-making methodology is introduced. The T2NN-ranking comparison and T2NN-criteria importance through intercriteria correlation methods are used to determine the weight of criteria, while T2NN-stable preference ordering towards ideal solution is utilized to rank the alternative models. Results show that the level of institutionalization is the most significant criterion, and income diversification is the most effective organizational model for improving NGO sustainability. The study not only provides practical guidance for NGO leaders but also introduces a robust methodological approach applicable to governance challenges under uncertain conditions."

A quantitative approach was used to collect new, practical evidence from 180 Australian and 85 Portuguese respondents, with a total of 265 respondents completing an online survey. This study identifies new positive factors to the Internet usage, as problem-solving skills, proactive study, information gathering, and awareness globally and locally; communication and collaboration with their peers and family were improved and enhanced. Alternatively, this study identifies new negative factors as physical contact and physical activities were prevented, thinking, concentrating and memory skills were reduced, depressed and isolated, laziness having increased, nevertheless; the Internet encourages Gens Y and Z to play physical and virtual games (e.g. Wii). Finally, this study concluded that the Internet is becoming an essential part of the everyday routines and practices of Gens Y and Z."

Such approaches aim at generating a reduced version of the corpus without decreasing the classification performance when compared to the initial set. Despite their large application in multiclass scenarios, very few works have addressed the proposal of PG methods for the multilabel space. In this regard, this work presents the novel adaptation of four multiclass PG strategies to the multilabel case. These proposals are evaluated with three multilabel kNN-based classifiers, 12 corpora comprising a varied range of domains and corpus sizes, and different noise scenarios artificially induced in the data. The results obtained show that the proposed adaptations are capable of significantly improving—both in terms of efficiency and classification performance—the only reference multilabel PG work in the literature as well as the case in which no PG method is applied, also presenting statistically superior robustness in noisy scenarios. Moreover, these novel PG strategies allow prioritising either the efficiency or efficacy criteria through its configuration depending on the target scenario, hence covering a wide area in the solution space not previously filled by other works."

Results revealed that the perspectives of African American women towards online collaborative learning could be categorized into three themes: (a) peer support perceived as a give-and-take process with a sense of fairness, (b) group member role as a formation of identity, and c) “frustration” as a common response to differing levels of peer participation and interaction. These emerging factors reflected African American women’s perceptions towards online collaborative learning and provided profound implications for future research and practice."

This is particularly true when handling imperfect data inputs in applications for Alzheimer’s patients. In this paper we first propose a typology of imperfection for data entered by Alzheimer’s patients or their caregivers in the context of these applications (mainly due to the memory discordance caused by the disease). This topology includes nine direct and three indirect imperfection types. The direct ones are deduced from the data inputs e.g. uncertainty and uselessness. The indirect imperfection types are deduced from the direct ones, e.g. the redundancy. We then propose an approach, called DBE_ALZ, that handles false data entry by estimating the believability of each data input. Based on the proposed typology, the falsity of these data is related to five imperfection types: uncertainty, confusion, typing error, wrong knowledge and inconsistency. DBE_ALZ includes a believability model that defines a set of dimensions and sub-dimensions allowing a qualitative estimation of the believability of a given data input. It is estimated based on its reasonableness and the reliability of its author. Compared to related work, the data input reasonableness is measured not only based on common-sense standard, but also based on a set of personalized assertions. The reliability of the patient is estimated based on the progression of the disease and the state of his memory at the moment of entry. However, the reliability of the caregiver is estimated based on his age and his knowledge about the data input’s field. Based on the believability model, we estimate quantitatively the believability of the data input by defining a set of metrics associated to the proposed dimensions and sub-dimensions. The measurement methods rely on probability and fuzzy set theories to reason about uncertain and imprecise knowledge (Bayesian networks and Mamdani fuzzy inference systems). Three languages are supported: English, French and Arabic. Based on the generated believability degrees, a set of decisive actions are proposed to guarantee the quality of the data inputs e.g., inferring or not based on a given data. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach in the context of the Captain Memo memory prosthesis. Finally, we discuss the encouraging results derived from the evaluation step."

Scarcity of pertinent data, however, makes it hard to determine whether accident characteristics, causal factors and remedial interventions identified elsewhere apply to the Gulf in comparable ways. This difficulty stems from unusual construction sector characteristics, notably a heterogeneous mix of expatriate laborers and firms working without a common language, work culture or labor practices. Does this change the mix of accident types or the ranking of main causes and priority remedies? To answer this question, a sample of 519 incident records was analyzed to determine whether accident types and frequencies are comparable to elsewhere. Site safety experts were then interviewed to determine whether rankings of factors and interventions should be similar. Findings are that types are indeed comparable, but the rankings of factors and interventions may not be. Main factors have to do with worker skills and training, experience, use of safety gear and risk perception. The overarching safety issue, however, is that firms and governments do not have strong incentive to address these factors."

Internet- and mobile-based mental health interventions have the potential to narrow the treatment gap in ethnic groups. Little evidence exists on the cultural adaptation of such interventions. Cultural adaptation of evidence-based interventions distinguishes between surface and deep structure adaptation. Surface refers to matching materials (e.g., illustrations, language) or methods of treatment delivery to the target population, whereas deep structure adaptation considers cultural concepts of distress (CCD). So far, CCD have only been considered to a limited extent in cultural adaptation of psychological interventions, and there is a lack of well documented adaptation procedures.
Aims
With a cross-disciplinary and mixed-method approach, following a new conceptual framework for cultural adaptation of scalable psychological interventions, this study aimed to develop both surface and deep structure adaptations of an internet- and mobile-based intervention called Hap-pas-Hapi for the treatment of psychological distress among Albanian migrants in Switzerland and Germany.
Methods
A qualitative ethnopsychological study was conducted to examine the target group's CCD. Focus group discussions, an online survey, and individual key informant interviews were utilised to evaluate the original intervention, adaptation drafts and the final adapted intervention. A reporting system was developed to support the decision-making process and to report all adaptations in a transparent and replicable way.
Results
The ongoing involvement of target population key informants provided valuable feedback for the development of a more person-centred intervention, which might enhance treatment acceptance, motivation and adherence.
Discussion
This study provides empirical and theory-based considerations and suggestions for future implementation that may foster acceptability and effectiveness of culturally adapted evidence-based interventions."

However, little research has been done on how party preference is related to politically active social media use. We begin with a consideration of how political participation on social media has evolved between various socio-economic and demographic groups in advanced information societies and especially in Finland. In our empirical analysis we examine the general use of social media as well as its use for political purposes with the aid of a nationally representative dataset, collected in 2017–2018 from 3724 Finnish citizens. We argue that there are notable differences between parties when examining their supporters’ social media use for political purposes. The differences are related to the digital divides and political extremes. The results confirmed the idea that new political movements made up of younger and more educated supporters have been successful by leveraging social media. The study also revealed that the ideological gap between party supporters is greater in social media especially when examining new kinds of politics based on cultural questions, identity issues, and post-materialist values."

This paper focuses on set-valued predicates, i.e., the relationship between an entity and a set of entities. In KBs, this information is often represented in two formats: (i) via counting predicates such as numberOfChildren and staffSize, that store aggregated integers, and (ii) via enumerating predicates such as parentOf and worksFor, that store individual set memberships. Both formats are typically complementary: unlike enumerating predicates, counting predicates do not give away individuals, but are more likely informative towards the true set size, thus this coexistence could enable interesting applications in question answering and KB curation. In this paper we aim at uncovering this hidden knowledge. We proceed in two steps. (i) We identify set-valued predicates from a given KB predicates via statistical and embedding-based features. (ii) We link counting predicates and enumerating predicates by a combination of co-occurrence, correlation and textual relatedness metrics. We analyse the prevalence of count information in four prominent knowledge bases, and show that our linking method achieves up to 0.55 F1 score in set predicate identification versus 0.40 F1 score of a random selection, and normalized discounted gains of up to 0.84 at position 1 and 0.75 at position 3 in relevant predicate alignments.

Survey data were collected from 1155 undergraduate students in a US public university. Findings showed that the bifactor model was the best fitting model and SAS is a unidimensional instrument. The composite scores made for the six domain-specific factors, often seen in the literature, were not reliable measures for the construct of smartphone addiction and can result in misleading or even incorrect inferential test results. The most reliable and contributing items identified by the bifactor model were selected to form a short, more efficient version of SAS. A Rasch model was performed to test the psychometric properties of the shortened SAS. The new shortened SAS contains 10 items (SAS-10) and had good reliability, construct validity, and no presence of bias towards students in different gender or academic achievement groups. Additional evidence suggests a 4-category rating scale is enough to capture the construct of smartphone addiction. Finally, SAS-10 correlated to numerous external criterion variables similarly to how the extant literature would predict. SAS-10 is provided in appendix C."
2019,Mobile Health for First Nations Populations: Systematic Review,Georgina R Hobson and Liam J Caffery and Maike Neuhaus and Danette H Langbecker,https://doi.org/10.2196/14877,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2291522219000652,,,,"Background
The ubiquitous presence and functionality of mobile devices offers the potential for mobile health (mHealth) to create equitable health opportunities. While mHealth is used among First Nations populations to respond to health challenges, the characteristics, uptake, and effectiveness of these interventions are unclear.
Objective
This review aimed to identify the characteristics of mHealth interventions (eg, study locations, health topic, and modality) evaluated with First Nations populations and to summarize the outcomes reported for intervention use, user perspectives including cultural responsiveness, and clinical effectiveness. In addition, the review sought to identify the presence of First Nations expertise in the design and evaluation of mHealth interventions with First Nations populations.
Methods
The methods of this systematic review were detailed in a registered protocol with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42019123276). Systematic searches of peer-reviewed, scientific papers were conducted across 7 databases in October 2018. Eligible studies had a primary focus on mHealth interventions with experimental or quasi-experimental design to respond to a health challenge with First Nations people from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Two authors independently screened records for eligibility and assessed risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Data were synthesized narratively owing to the mix of study designs, interventions, and outcomes. The review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
Results
Searches yielded 1053 unique records, after review and screening, 13 studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 8 quasi-experimental designs) were included in the final analysis. Studies were conducted in Australia (n=9), the United States (n=2), and New Zealand (n=2). The most common health challenge addressed was mental health and suicide (n=5). Intervention modalities included text messaging (n=5), apps (n=4), multimedia messaging (n=1), tablet software (n=1), or a combination of short messaging service (SMS) and apps (n=1). Results showed mixed engagement with the intervention (n=3); favorable user perspectives, including acceptability and cultural appropriateness (n=6); and mixed outcomes for clinical effectiveness (n=10). A diverse range of risks of bias were identified, the most common of which included a lack of clarity about allocation and blinding protocols and group treatment for randomized controlled trials and a lack of control group and single outcome measures for quasi-experimental designs. First Nations expertise informed all mHealth studies, through authorship (n=8), affiliation with First Nations bodies (n=3), participatory study design (n=5), First Nations reference groups (n=5), or a combination of these.
Conclusions
mHealth modalities, including SMS and apps, appear favorable for delivery of health interventions with First Nations populations, particularly in the area of mental health and suicide prevention. Importantly, First Nations expertise was strongly embedded within the studies, augmenting favorable use and user engagement. However, evidence of efficacy is limited."
2020,‘Big time’: An examination of temporal complexity and business value in analytics,Kieran Conboy and Denis Dennehy and Mairead O'Connor,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2018.05.010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720617309072,,,,"Time is central to the purported business value of analytics. Yet, research has adopted a simplistic, ‘clock’ interpretation of time, ignoring its complex and socially embedded nature. There is also an overemphasis on analytics software and not on the people using them. Although analytics may be ‘fast’ to realise business value, it must cater to temporal complexities of organisations and people using it. Drawing on the temporality theory, this study develops temporal factors to examine the value of analytics. We also develop a research agenda that identifies opportunities to examine time, temporal personalities and other factors when people use analytics in the organisation."

We improve over previous reviews with wider coverage from 2017 to 2020 as well as a study focused on the underlying ideas and commonalities behind the different solutions to achieve multilingual sentiment analysis. Interesting findings of our research are (i) the shift of research interest to cross-lingual and code-switching approaches, (ii) the apparent stagnation of the less complex architectures derived from a backbone featuring an embedding layer, a feature extractor based on a single CNN or LSTM and a classifier, (iii) the lack of approaches tackling multilingual aspect-based sentiment analysis through deep learning, and, surprisingly, (iv) the lack of more complex architectures such as the transformers-based, despite results suggest the more difficult tasks requires more elaborated architectures."
2020,A framework for competence development and assessment in hybrid cybersecurity exercises,Agnė Brilingaitė and Linas Bukauskas and Aušrius Juozapavičius,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2019.101607,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404819301580,,,,"Rising numbers and sophistication of security threats in the digital domain cause an increase in the demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals. In response, cybersecurity exercises, and in particular—cyber defence exercises (CDX) are becoming ever more popular. They provide a training platform to simulate real-life situations. CDX are significant events involving months of preparation, and previous studies show a lack of objective evidence of their relevance regarding the learning impact. Skills of exercise participants are usually different and vary from tech-savvy to beginners. Also, trainees are diverse when considering their background, current work profile (position and institution), and experience. Assessment of their competencies is essential to ensure quality in training. The complexity and multi-dimensionality of the usual CDX make it challenging. Additionally, the costly event usually focuses on just a subset of participants, and non-technical members of an organisation are not included. The goal of our research is to provide a proper methodology to optimise the exercises so that every team and each participant, including a non-technical trainee, are adequately evaluated and trained using the allocated resources most effectively. This paper presents a framework to aid in the development and assessment of cybersecurity competences of all teams during hybrid CDX. The framework aims towards raised cybersecurity awareness—a state when every user of digital technologies understands the associated risks. The framework consists of a sequence of steps including stages of formative assessment, team construction, determination of objectives for different types of teams, and the exercise flow. It complements standard methodologies for cybersecurity training programs. The framework was developed based on data collected using questionnaires, interviews, and direct observation in a case study carried out during international cybersecurity exercises. The framework would help organise hybrid exercises for a diverse community of trainees, including non-technical members of an organisation."
2021,A joint learning approach with knowledge injection for zero-shot cross-lingual hate speech detection,Endang Wahyu Pamungkas and Valerio Basile and Viviana Patti,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2021.102544,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457321000510,,,,"Hate speech is an increasingly important societal issue in the era of digital communication. Hateful expressions often make use of figurative language and, although they represent, in some sense, the dark side of language, they are also often prime examples of creative use of language. While hate speech is a global phenomenon, current studies on automatic hate speech detection are typically framed in a monolingual setting. In this work, we explore hate speech detection in low-resource languages by transferring knowledge from a resource-rich language, English, in a zero-shot learning fashion. We experiment with traditional and recent neural architectures, and propose two joint-learning models, using different multilingual language representations to transfer knowledge between pairs of languages. We also evaluate the impact of additional knowledge in our experiment, by incorporating information from a multilingual lexicon of abusive words. The results show that our joint-learning models achieve the best performance on most languages. However, a simple approach that uses machine translation and a pre-trained English language model achieves a robust performance. In contrast, Multilingual BERT fails to obtain a good performance in cross-lingual hate speech detection. We also experimentally found that the external knowledge from a multilingual abusive lexicon is able to improve the models’ performance, specifically in detecting the positive class. The results of our experimental evaluation highlight a number of challenges and issues in this particular task. One of the main challenges is related to the issue of current benchmarks for hate speech detection, in particular how bias related to the topical focus in the datasets influences the classification performance. The insufficient ability of current multilingual language models to transfer knowledge between languages in the specific hate speech detection task also remain an open problem. However, our experimental evaluation and our qualitative analysis show how the explicit integration of linguistic knowledge from a structured abusive language lexicon helps to alleviate this issue."

Evacuation experiments were conducted in an immersive virtual metro station, in which each participant was presented with one of three different patterns of crowd flow and asked to complete an evacuation task. The patterns of crowd flow were represented by non-player characters that split differently at each wayfinding decision point in the metro station. The experiments were conducted in Beijing, Los Angeles and London. The results showed that uneven splits of crowd flow motivated participants under mental stress to follow the majority of the crowd. This influence of crowd flow was generally consistent over the course of evacuation, and such consistency could be reinforced by stronger directional information conveyed by the crowd flow as well as positive feedback from the outcomes of previous wayfinding decisions. The results also indicated that the influence of crowd flow was significant in all three cultures represented by the three cities, however, the impact of culture on how participants would respond to the directional information conveyed by the crowd flow was insignificant."
2019,Resilience of distributed student teams to stress factors: A longitudinal case-study,Igor Čavrak and Ivana Bosnić and Federico Ciccozzi and Raffaela Mirandola,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2019.05.011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584918301228,,,,"Context: Teaching global software engineering is continuously evolving and improving to prepare future software engineers adequately. Geographically distributed work in project-oriented software development courses is both demanding and rewarding for student teams, who are susceptible to various risks stemming from different internal and external factors, being the sources of stress and impacting team performance. Objective: In this paper, we analyze the resilience of teams of students working in a geographically fully distributed setting. Resilience is analyzed in relation to two representative stress factors: non-contributing team members and changes to customer project requirements. We also reason on team collaboration patterns and analyze potential dependencies among these collaboration patterns, team resilience and stress factors. Method: We conduct a longitudinal case-study over five years on our Distributed Software Development (DSD) course. Based on empirical data, we study team resilience to two stress factors by observing their impact on process and product quality aspects of team performance. The same performance aspects are studied for identified collaboration patterns, and bidirectional influence between patterns and resilience is investigated. Results: Teams with up to two non-contributing members experience graceful degradation of performance indicators. A large number of non-contributing students almost guarantees the occurrence of educationally undesirable collaboration patterns. Exposed to requirements change stress, less resilient teams tend to focus on delivering the functional product rather than retaining a proper development process. Conclusions: Practical recommendations to be applied in contexts similar to our case have been provided at the end of the study. They include suggestions to mitigate the sources of stress, for example, by careful planning the team organization and balancing the number of regular and exchange students, or by discussing the issue of changing requirements with the external customers before the start of the project."

Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) may play an important role in bringing about changes in attitude and behavior because they potentially allow tailored but anonymous, free and convenient access and can deliver the information in a conversational way that overcomes health literacy barriers. In this first study we compare the use of an ECA with a video to deliver two strategies (education and contact) to address stigma around the mental health condition of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Our results with 245 participants show that both media (ECA and video) aided recognition of AN and produced significant changes in positive volitional stigma and negative volitional stigma but not in traditional stigma (desire for social distance), with some notable differences based on gender. Baseline data was used in place of a control group and the sample population was undergraduate Psychology students due to higher incidences of AN in this population. Further validation is needed involving a control group and testing on populations other than Psychology students. Nevertheless, these initial results encourage our future work to build tailored ECAs to challenge particular beliefs to support a wide range of educational interventions to change behaviors and improve decision-making relating to health and wellbeing."

Nevertheless, with the inherently heterogeneous and dynamic property of multiple tasks, we inevitably face several challenges, such as the implementation feasibility, when dealing with the growing number of new tasks of interest. For this reason, in this study, we endeavour to shed some fresh light on shifting the conventional isolated affective computing into a lifelong learning paradigm, namely continual affective computing. As the first tentative work in audio and video domains, we explore the lifelong learning algorithm of elastic weight consolidation for this benchmark work, in an application of well-established audiovisual emotion recognition in a cross-culture scenario, i.e., French and German emotion recognition. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the introduced lifelong learning, we perform extensive experiments across the RECOLA and SEWA databases. The empirical results show that the implemented lifelong learning approach remarkably outperforms other baselines in most cases, and is even competitive to the joint training process in some cases, indicating its capability when handling the sequential learning process with multiple tasks."

Health information is currently truly ubiquitous and widespread, but in order to guarantee that everyone can appropriately access and understand this information, regardless of their origin, it is essential to bridge the international gap. The diversity of health information seekers languages and cultures signifies that e-health applications must be adapted to satisfy their needs. Methods: In order to achieve this objective, current and future e-health programs should take into account the internationalization aspects. This paper presents an internationalization requirements specification in the form of a reusable requirements catalog, obtained from the principal related standards, and describes the key methodological elements needed to perform an e-health software audit by using the internationalization knowledge previously gathered. Results: S Health, a relevant, well-known Android application that has more than 150 million users in over 130 countries, was selected as a target for the e-health internationalization audit method and requirements specification presented above. This application example helped us to put into practice the proposal and show that the procedure is realistic and effective. Conclusions: The approach presented in this study is subject to continuous improvement through the incorporation of new knowledge originating from additional information sources, such as other standards or stakeholders. The application example is useful for early evaluation and serves to assess the applicability of the internationalization catalog and audit methodology, and to improve them. It would be advisable to develop of an automated tool with which to carry out the audit method."

Today, the visibility of technological innovations has become essential to achieve the targeted market. It is now very difficult for a product manufacturer to reach customers without owning a website that is visible on search engine results pages. The goal of this paper is to build information channels between a company and its customers through improving both a company’s content of information on the Web and its website rank on the Internet through search engine results pages. Company information and knowledge are distributed through multiple stakeholders. The problem of building information channels between a company and customers is solved through a collaborative and distributed approach, on the one hand, and is supported by decision-making tools, on the other hand. The paper proposes an engineering model for building information channels and improving the visibility of the company on the Web. Agents are used for the implementation of the approach. The proposed model and its implementation handle the requirements, constraints, functions and solutions for improving Web visibility. The prototype tool, called CAWIS (Computer Aided Web Information Sharing), examines Web visibility in real time and evaluates the performance of the proposed content of information. CAWIS allows an exploratory and open way for building information channels and improving the visibility of product manufacturers on the Web."

Using data collected from a survey of 1,650 citizen users living in one direct-controlled municipality and four high-population cities in China, this study verifies the components of e-government service quality through partial least squares (PLS) analysis and then tests the proposed concept model using structural equation modeling. The results reveal that the concept of e-government service quality has eight contributing dimensions: system quality, reliability, security, accessibility, information quality, service capability, interactivity, and responsiveness. Perceived service value is a powerful mediator between service quality and citizens’ continuous-use intention. The intention to use is a consequence of service quality, service value, and satisfaction."

Method
Interviews were conducted with staff from residential aged care and logistics/transport organisations in Australia. Transcripts were analysed using a worker-centred systems framework.
Results and conclusions
Many barriers to more effective risk management were identified. Most fundamentally, few people knew of the need to manage MSD risk arising from work-related psychosocial hazards, and OHS-related skills of key managers were often reported as inadequate, particularly concerning management of risk from psychosocial hazards. Also, funding and staffing levels were often reported as problematic, and OHS issues were seen as lower priority than accreditation and commercial requirements."

Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms."

We sought to comprehend to what extent the application supports children in creating a narrative, and which type of prompts (basic dialogic reading and theory of mind prompts) better support their meaningful responses. Initial findings suggest how children were able to respond meaningfully to prompts and reported high levels of enjoyment of the activity. Furthermore, theory of mind prompts resulted in a marginally higher percentage of meaningful responses and theory of mind language compared to basic dialogic reading prompts. Study outcomes helped to delineate the design space that we shaped into six design challenges that aim to inform the community and guide the future design of tools to support children in independent dialogic reading of wordless picture e-books."

Some fear that the new powers facilitate the creation of encryption backdoors that could be exploited by bad actors. This paper examines the so-called ‘systemic weakness’ limitation, which was designed to allay these fears. The paper concludes that the limitation is effective at preventing the most blatant, wholesale encryption backdoors, yet is not a panacea against all cybersecurity-related concerns that the instrument brings, and its efficacy in practice is likely to be undermined by its substantive and procedural complexity."

Job burnout may hinder employees’ quality of life, personal accomplishment and satisfaction with life in general. It can also influence negatively the profits of the business or the organization, as the literature reveals. Mindfulness-based interventions have proven to be useful for ameliorating some aspects of burnout. By the same token, some agent-based simulator (ABSs) have been useful for predicting the influence of mindfulness programs on meditators in different aspects such as their emotions and their heart rate variability. In this context, the current work presents a novel ABS application that simulates the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on the job burnout subscales known as emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment, exhaustion in general, and disengagement from work. This application allows users to define mindfulness programs without needing any computer-science technical knowledge and simulates its influence on a group of practitioners with certain features. The simulator has been tested by simulating two mindfulness-based interventions of two scenarios reported in the literature. The ABS received input from the pre-intervention burnout measures, and performed 1000 simulations for each scenario for avoiding bias from the nondeterministic behavior. The simulated outcomes referring to the post-intervention burnout measures were similar to the real ones. The mean differences, mean squared errors and mean absolute error were below 0.4% in the normalized values of all the burnout subscales reported in the two scenarios. The source code of this ABS is publicly available for guaranteeing reproducibility and allowing other researchers to extend it or reuse some of its components."
2017,Benefits and limitations of project-to-project job rotation in software organizations: A synthesis of evidence,Ronnie E.S.

Job rotation has been proposed as a managerial practice to be applied in the organizational environment to reduce job monotony, boredom, and exhaustion resulting from job simplification, specialization, and repetition. The scientific literature distinguishes between job-to-job and project-to-project rotations. Despite the potential benefits and its actual use on behalf of software companies, we do not have an accumulated body of scientific knowledge about benefits and limitations of job rotation in software engineering practice. In particular, we have no concrete empirical evidence about the use of project-to-project rotations in practice.
Goal
We aim to identify and discuss evidence about project-to-project (P2P) job rotation, in order to understand the potential benefits and limitations of this practice in software organizations.
Method
We deployed a mix-method research strategy to collect and analyze empirical evidence from the scientific literature, performing a systematic literature review, on one hand and from industrial practice, performing qualitative case studies on the other. We synthesized the evidence using techniques from meta-ethnography.
Results
We found eight benefits, nine limitations, and two factors classified as both benefits and limitations of P2P rotations in software engineering. Different research methods yielded confirmatory and complementary evidence, emphasizing the importance of conducting mix-method research. We found no contradictory evidence and five factors were identified in more than one study using different research methods, contributing to the strength of the evidence.
Conclusion
We synthesized evidence from multiple sources and used different research methods concerning the benefits and limitations of P2P rotation in software engineering practice. Our findings show that rotation tends to benefit important job outcomes, such as motivation, and to decrease job monotony. The main limitations were associated with the potential increase in intra-group social conflicts, individual cognitive effort, and workload, and a temporary decrease in productivity."

It starts with the introduction of different types of users and their use of digital libraries, ranging from children to college students to elderly people to people with disabilities. This chapter highlights the research on search tactics and information-seeking strategies as applied in the digital libraries. At the same time, usage patterns, in particular log analysis of digital library usage, are presented and compared to data generated from other types of digital environments. While users take leading roles in applying some search tactics, systems play dominant roles in other tactics. User engagement and system support for different types of search tactics in the search process are illustrated. Moreover, factors influencing digital library use are analyzed, including users’ personal infrastructure, types of tasks, and system design."

Participants (N = 726) were recruited to fill up a questionnaire, and the self-reported data was used to test our hypothesis. The study followed a correlational, non-experimental approach to investigate the mediation models as proposed. Structural Equational Modelling eluded a positive and significant relationship between age and the social issues with control variables as the frequency and time spent on Instagram. Moreover, it was found that social comparison can lead to colourism and mental health issues. Gender was, however, found to have insignificant relation with three parameters. Qualitative analysis was supported to find important implications for all Instagram stakeholders. Discussions were drawn indicating the need to raise awareness regarding these issues to enjoy social media while safeguarding the user's well-being. The paper provides critical key findings delving into the realms of these parameters, and such implications are further discussed to understand its reflection in online spaces."

Although a growing body of scholarship has emerged to assess the normative and legal dimensions of these regulatory developments in Germany and beyond, the legal scholarship on intermediary liability leaves key questions about why and how these policies are developed, shaped, and adopted unanswered. The goal of this article is thus to provide a deep case study into the NetzDG from a regulatory politics perspective, highlighting the importance of political and regulatory factors currently under-explored in the burgeoning interdisciplinary literatures on platform governance and platform regulation. The empirical account presented here, which draws on 30 interviews with stakeholders involved in the debate around the NetzDG's adoption, as well as hundreds of pages of deliberative documents obtained via freedom of information access requests, outlines how the NetzDG took shape, and how it overcame various significant obstacles (ranging from resistance from other stakeholders and the European Union's frameworks against regulatory fragmentation) to eventually become law. The article argues, throughout this case study, that both domestic politics and transnational institutional constraints are crucial policy factors that should receive more attention as an important part of platform regulation debates."
2019,How social media usage affects employees’ job satisfaction and turnover intention: An empirical study in China,Xin Zhang and Liang Ma and Bo Xu and Feng Xu,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2018.12.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037872061731039X,,,,"Social media are frequently used in enterprises for both work-related and non-work-related (social) purposes. Drawing on the organizational commitment theory, we developed a research model to explore how different purposes of social media usage affect employees’ job satisfaction and turnover intention in the Chinese context. Online and offline surveys were conducted in China, generating 298 valid responses for analysis. The results suggest that the following: (1) work-related and social-related social media usage positively affects employees’ organizational commitment through their organizational engagement; (2) social media usage improves job satisfaction and reduces employees’ turnover intention through improving their engagement and organizational commitment; and (3) in the process of social media usage influencing employees’ job satisfaction and turnover intention, employees of different genders show significant differences."
2018,1.07 - Geospatial Semantics,Yingjie Hu,https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-409548-9.09597-X,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012409548909597X,Elsevier,Comprehensive Geographic Information Systems,Bo Huang,"Geospatial semantics is a broad field that involves a variety of research areas. The term semantics refers to the meaning of things and is in contrast with the term syntactics. Accordingly, studies on geospatial semantics usually focus on understanding the meaning of geographic entities as well as their counterparts in the cognitive and digital world, such as cognitive geographic concepts and digital gazetteers. geospatial semantics can facilitate the design of geographic information systems by enhancing the interoperability of distributed systems and developing more intelligent interfaces for user interactions. During the past years, a lot of research has been conducted, approaching geospatial semantics from different perspectives, using a variety of methods, and targeting different problems. Meanwhile, the arrival of big geo data, especially the large amount of unstructured text data on the Web, and the fast development of natural language processing methods enable new research directions in geospatial semantics. This article, therefore, provides a systematic review on the existing geospatial semantic research. Six major research areas are identified and discussed, including semantic interoperability, digital gazetteers, geographic information retrieval, geospatial Semantic Web, place semantics, and cognitive geographic concepts."
2016,Reformation of public service to meet citizens’ needs as customers: Evaluating SMS as an alternative service delivery channel,Mahmud Akhter Shareef and Yogesh K. Dwivedi and Vinod Kumar and Uma Kumar,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.03.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563216301649,,,,"Citizens of different countries are now experiencing a newly invented service delivery channel to receive service from government portals. This study addresses whether a service delivery channel, based on mobile phones and provided through a short messaging service can be included in public administration to meet citizen requirements. The study further examines what factors are important to develop citizen perceptions of high value and effectiveness of this new service delivery channel. It also attempts to identify if culture has any effect on developing a positive attitude toward this service delivery channel. This study, through an empirical investigation among citizens in three countries – the USA, India, and Bangladesh, has identified that citizens are quite satisfied with this new service delivery channel use by the public service domain. The success of this delivery channel depends on the issue of segmentation. If public service providers can effectively segment the market based on time, location, and requirements, and can deliver the preferred message to concerned users with relevant and information that is easy to access and process, citizens will regard this service delivery channel as effective and satisfactory, and as competent as its private counterparts."
2022,FELIDS: Federated learning-based intrusion detection system for agricultural Internet of Things,Othmane Friha and Mohamed Amine Ferrag and Lei Shu and Leandros Maglaras and Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo and Mehdi Nafaa,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2022.03.003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731522000570,,,,"In this paper, we propose a federated learning-based intrusion detection system, named FELIDS, for securing agricultural-IoT infrastructures. Specifically, the FELIDS system protects data privacy through local learning, where devices benefit from the knowledge of their peers by sharing only updates from their model with an aggregation server that produces an improved detection model. In order to prevent Agricultural IoTs attacks, the FELIDS system employs three deep learning classifiers, namely, deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. We study the performance of the proposed IDS on three different sources, including, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, MQTTset, and InSDN. The results demonstrate that the FELIDS system outperforms the classic/centralized versions of machine learning (non-federated learning) in protecting the privacy of IoT devices data and achieves the highest accuracy in detecting attacks."
2025,From efficiency to immersion: understanding generational differences in avatar interactions,Shashank Singh Pawar and Anubhav A. Mishra,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2025.108732,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563225001797,,,,"This study uses socioemotional selectivity theory to examine how the core typology of avatar design, both in form and behavioral realism, impacts consumer interactions across generations. Understanding avatar design influence is essential as it increasingly shapes online consumer experiences. Although research exists, the combined effects of form and behavioral realism on consumer interaction responses remain underexplored. Through in-depth interviews with 45 participants across Generations X, Millennials (Y), and Z, this research identifies key design elements that enhance avatar design. Findings indicate that the spatial dimension of avatars, including variations in shape, significantly contributes to form realism. Additionally, behavioral elements such as communication modalities, competence, empathy, and dynamic interactions enhance behavioral realism. Also, we find significant differences in the cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses to avatar interaction across generations. These interactive responses are also influenced by contingency factors such as inter-avatar dynamics, media channel preferences (mobile versus fixed devices), and privacy risk. We propose a framework for aligning avatars’ design typology to enhance consumer interaction, offering valuable insights for marketers and designers aiming to optimize avatar-driven experiences across age groups."

A cross-country analysis,Enrique Marinao-Artigas and Karla Barajas-Portas,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2019.100919,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567422319300961,,,,"This investigation into m-commerce suggests a model in which some experiential dimensions of online shopping act as antecedents of m-shopper satisfaction. Causal relationships are tested by a model of structural equations. A non-probabilistic convenience sample composed of mobile buyers from Chile and Mexico is used. The results show that the m-shopper's satisfaction with their online shopping experience is a consequence of the reputation and trust that they perceive of mobile commerce. In turn, it is confirmed that satisfaction is a reaction to the affective evaluation of the mobile shopper. Affective evaluation is understood as the result of the hedonic and functional attributes perceived by mobile shoppers in their online shopping experience. Among m-shoppers from Chile and Mexico, differences are observed in the relationships between reputation and trust and between functional benefit and affective evaluation. This study contains some implications for mobile commerce managers who want to improve mobile buyer satisfaction."
2018,Diversification and obfuscation techniques for software security: A systematic literature review,Shohreh Hosseinzadeh and Sampsa Rauti and Samuel Laurén and Jari-Matti Mäkelä and Johannes Holvitie and Sami Hyrynsalmi and Ville Leppänen,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2018.07.007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584918301484,,,,"Context: Diversification and obfuscation are promising techniques for securing software and protecting computers from harmful malware. The goal of these techniques is not removing the security holes, but making it difficult for the attacker to exploit security vulnerabilities and perform successful attacks. Objective: There is an increasing body of research on the use of diversification and obfuscation techniques for improving software security; however, the overall view is scattered and the terminology is unstructured. Therefore, a coherent review gives a clear statement of state-of-the-art, normalizes the ongoing discussion and provides baselines for future research. Method: In this paper, systematic literature review is used as the method of the study to select the studies that discuss diversification/obfuscation techniques for improving software security. We present the process of data collection, analysis of data, and report the results. Results: As the result of the systematic search, we collected 357 articles relevant to the topic of our interest, published between the years 1993 and 2017. We studied the collected articles, analyzed the extracted data from them, presented classification of the data, and enlightened the research gaps. Conclusion: The two techniques have been extensively used for various security purposes and impeding various types of security attacks. There exist many different techniques to obfuscate/diversify programs, each of which targets different parts of the programs and is applied at different phases of software development life-cycle. Moreover, we pinpoint the research gaps in this field, for instance that there are still various execution environments that could benefit from these two techniques, including cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and trusted computing. We also present some potential ideas on applying the techniques on the discussed environments."

Guide to the software engineering body of knowledge (SWEBOK) which has evolved to become ISO/IEC 19759 standard has identified various knowledge areas to be part of any SE curricula. Although there is a number of studies that address the gap between SE curricula and software industry, the literature lacks defining a process that can be leveraged for continuously improving SE curricula to fulfill the software development market demands. Objective: In this paper, we propose a Software Engineering Curricula Development and Evaluation Process (SECDEP) that takes advantage of the SWEBOK guidelines to improve the quality of SE programs based on objective and subjective evidences. Method: Our process consists of multi-steps in which the local software market needs and the target SE program objectives and constraints are all taken into consideration. As a case study, we follow our process to investigate the core SE courses delivered as part of the SE curricula in a set of universities in our region. Results: The conducted case study identifies the factors that might contribute to mitigating the skills shortages in the target software market. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our process by identifying the weaknesses of the studied SE curricula and presenting recommendations to align the studied curricula with the demands of the target software market, which assists SE educators in the design and evaluation of their SE curricula. Conclusion: Based on the obtained results, the studied SE curricula can be enhanced by incorporating latest SE technologies, covering most of the SWEBOK knowledge areas, adopting SE curricula standards, and increasing the level of industrial involvement in SE curricula. We believe that achieving these enhancements by SE educators will have a positive impact on the SE curricula in question."

These domains are primarily concentrated within nonprofit services and local development. However, there are many other disciplines and application areas for which novel applications and extensions of Community OR could generate valuable insights. This paper identifies a number of these, distinguishing between ‘emerging trends’ (mostly in well-studied areas of operational research, management science and analytics) and ‘new frontiers’, which can be found in traditions not commonly oriented towards empirical and analytical methods for problem solving, where community-engaged decision modeling represents new ways of generating knowledge, policies and prescriptions. This paper will show how the exploration of emerging trends and new frontiers in Community OR can provide a basis for the development of innovative research agendas that can broaden the scope and impact of the decision sciences."

These data are distributed and dispersed in several heterogeneous data sources. These peculiarities make that geographic information retrieval being a non-trivial task, considering that the spatial data are often unstructured and built by different collaborative communities from social networks. The problem arises when user queries are performed with different levels of semantic granularity. This fact is very typical in social communities, where users have different levels of expertise. In this paper, a novelty approach based on three matching-query layers driven by ontologies on the heterogeneous data sources is presented. A technique of query contextualization is proposed for addressing to available heterogeneous data sources including social networks. It consists of contextualizing a query in which whether a data source does not contain a relevant result, other sources either provide an answer or in the best case, each one adds a relevant answer to the set of results. This approach is a collaborative learning system based on experience level of users in different domains. The retrieval process is achieved from three domains: temporal, geographical and social, which are involved in the user-content context. The work is oriented towards defining a GIScience collaborative learning for geographic information retrieval, using social networks, web and geodatabases."

However, the challenge of making sense of all this data remains an open problem. In this paper, we present and evaluate an Information Extraction pipeline aimed at the construction of a Music Knowledge Base. Our approach starts off by collecting thousands of stories about songs from the songfacts.com website. Then, we combine a state-of-the-art Entity Linking tool and a linguistically motivated rule-based algorithm to extract semantic relations between entity pairs. Next, relations with similar semantics are grouped into clusters by exploiting syntactic dependencies. These relations are ranked thanks to a novel confidence measure based on statistical and linguistic evidence. Evaluation is carried out intrinsically, by assessing each component of the pipeline, as well as in an extrinsic task, in which we evaluate the contribution of natural language explanations in music recommendation. We demonstrate that our method is able to discover novel facts with high precision, which are missing in current generic as well as music-specific knowledge repositories."
2015,Utilizing online serious games to facilitate distributed requirements elicitation,Hadi Ghanbari and Jouni Similä and Jouni Markkula,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2015.07.017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121215001491,,,,"Requirements elicitation is one of the most important and challenging activities in software development projects. A variety of challenges related to requirements elicitation are reported in the literature, of which the lack of proper communication and knowledge transfer between software stakeholders are among the most important. Communication and knowledge transfer are becoming even bigger challenges with the current increase in globally distributed software development projects due to the temporal, geographic, and sociocultural diversity among software stakeholders. In this study, we propose a new approach to requirements elicitation, which employs online serious games for gathering requirements from distributed software stakeholders. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach were evaluated in an empirical study with encouraging results. These results especially reveal that our suggested approach enables less-experienced individuals to identify a higher number of requirements. Our results also reveal that for the majority of subjects, especially individuals with less technical experience, this approach was a pleasant and easy way of participating in requirements elicitation. Based on these results we suggest that using online serious games not only enhances innovation and creativity among end-users but also facilitates collaboration and communication among software stakeholders. Implications for both research and practice are considered."

This gap presents a unique opportunity for children across the globe to become co-designers of their own digital inclusive learning environment. From a political perspective we strive for a pluriversal design of a hybrid distributed participatory design space using a transcultural approach. Thus in this paper we literally push boundaries in PD as (1) we reflect on two exploratory studies where we engaged children from Finland together with ”underrepresented children in PD”, namely from Namibia and Malaysia, thereby contributing to pluriversality; (2) we expand the concept of transcultural competencies in digital design inspired through co-designing with mixed groups of children from different geographical locations; (3) we raise practical issues requiring attention and further research, namely team building considering goals, social relations, skills and roles of participating children, facilitation goals and challenges, and technologies to enable conducive geographically distributed co-design."

While prior research has mainly relied on analysis of Twitter data from the #MeToo period, this study compares such disclosures across platforms over two years. Using machine learning, 2927 disclosures were identified for quantitative content analysis and multiple correspondence analysis. Online platforms differed in timing of the posts, information shared, information density, co-occurrence of information and the length of the disclosure message. Most disclosures were found on the platform Twitter, and during the #MeToo movement. These posts differ from disclosures on other platforms and outside the viral movement. Regarding the content, across all platforms and periods, clustering was found around offender-oriented information, making the offender an explicit part of the experience. This study shows that an exclusive focus on online disclosures on Twitter and during viral movements gives a biased and incomplete picture of what online disclosure of sexual victimisation entails. Our cross-platform analysis over time allows for more universal statements about the content and context of online disclosures of sexual victimisation."

This study intends to address these challenges by proposing an adaptive TRS, which mainly consists of three modules: data collection, itinerary design, and itinerary adjustment. To evaluate the proposed system’s performance, a case study was conducted in Xiamen, China. Results indicated that our system can adapt to uncertain environments and tourists’ changing on-site behavior. Tourism organizations could integrate our system in upgrading their information service platforms as part of their smart tourism construction to enhance the competitiveness of destinations."

The educator with his past learning cannot match the expectations of the millennials. The VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) in Engineering Education has to be observed, studied, analysed and reformed and that too very soon. Higher Education is unable to evolve in pace with the technological developments, global economics, and digital transformations. Global networking has shrunk the world and established inter-connectedness breaking barriers of language, geography, societal cultures, and perceptions. However such rapid changes have not impacted Engineering Education much. Academicians prophecies about attributes that an engineer should possess are turning volatile. This uncertainty leads to unemployed engineers. The chaos has emerged with various levels of complexities. With under-skilled employees, the future of the Engineers and Engineering Education looks bleak and ambiguous. Jack of all trades will have more employable possibilities than the Master of a particular skill. The faculty who teach the 21st Century Learner therefore must make a conscious, intentional choice to enhance his competencies to prepare students for the future. This study emphasizes the need to reawaken our educational policies and teaching-learning pedagogy. Certain learning strategies like flipped learning, project-based learning, problem-based learning will adapt the andragogic method. The teaching trends will be metamorphosed and establish good networking for inter/transdisciplinary research. Case studies and scenario building will churn in opportunities for the students to communicate, collaborate, critically think, and be creative. The empowered faculty will have his multi-skilled students placed well, the student will be industry ready and the industry will have the employee come along with his 21st Century skill set. The beneficiaries: the school, university, teacher now a facilitator, the student and the community at large will build not only a sustainable future but a thriving one too!"

Thematic analysis revealed that over 14% of the Facebook wall posts/status updates (N=714) contained academic themes; positive states were more frequent than negative and neutral states and students with lower GPAs expressed negative states more often. A path analysis suggested that academic performance may determine college students’ Facebook use, rather than the reverse. Implications for student support services are discussed."

As our understanding on negative consequences is limited, this research will address this knowledge gap by concentrating on challenges and difficulties when it comes to education in smart cities. The articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science were review and a qualitative analysis of the articles fitting our research criteria was done. Three themes were identified: shortcomings on the existing educational initiatives to address the needs of smart cities, negative consequences of smart city education in other areas and problems that arise as a result of employing technology in education."

In this paper, we present and discuss the results, in terms of complexity, of the introduction of a new scheduling system within the medical appointment and exam business processes of a large hospital. During the case study, we began by modelling the processes using the Business Process Modelling and Notation (BPMN) standard. We then used abstract metrics to compare the complexity between old (before the introduction of the scheduling system) and new processes, and interpreted the obtained results. Finally, we derived important conclusions that will help guide us in further business process optimization endeavors."

An open-ended questionnaire and a semi-structured interview were used to glean the data. The results of MAXQDA analysis evinced that Chinese EFL learners had experienced a wide spectrum of positive and negative emotions in light of AI-based L2 education. Moreover, it was found that the participants took advantage of different antecedent-focused and response-focused strategies to regulate their AI-induced emotions. The study discusses the implications of AI-based L2 education and calls for further research on the linkage of AI and L2 emotions."

Radiomics is a field of quantitative imaging involving the extraction of features from medical images transforming them into mineable data for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive purposes. In this work, we focused on the analysis of 2D brightfield images acquired with standard microscopes today available in all biological laboratories.
Methods
We analysed images of 3D multicellular spheroids, an in vitro model commonly used in Regenerative Medicine and Oncology. Besides describing Analysis of Spheroid version 3.0 (AnaSP 3.0), a new release of an open-source software suite specifically designed for segmenting and extracting features from 2D brightfield spheroid images. To validate the tool, spheroids generated with U-shape bottom multi-well plates and different concentrations of mesenchymal stem cells and osteosarcoma cell lines have been used.
Results
We demonstrated how advanced features included in AnaSP 3.0, i.e. sphericity, volume, and image gradient, may be used to indirectly assess the spheroidization of the spheroids over time, the number of cells composing the spheroids, and the extension of a possible central necrotic core.
Conclusions

The digital document needs to be evaluated physically through the Cross-Language Text Summarization (CLTS) involved in the disparate and generation of the source documents. Cross-language document processing is involved in the generation of documents from disparate language sources toward targeted documents. The digital documents need to be processed with the contextual semantic data with the decoding scheme. This paper presented a multilingual cross-language processing of the documents with the abstractive and summarising of the documents. The proposed model is represented as the Hidden Markov Model LSTM Reinforcement Learning (HMMlstmRL). First, the developed model uses the Hidden Markov model for the computation of keywords in the cross-language words for the clustering. In the second stage, bi-directional long-short-term memory networks are used for key word extraction in the cross-language process. Finally, the proposed HMMlstmRL uses the voting concept in reinforcement learning for the identification and extraction of the keywords. The performance of the proposed HMMlstmRL is 2% better than that of the conventional bi-direction LSTM model."

The scientific community has called for careful usage of the approach and its inference. Meanwhile, the alternative method, Bayesian statistics, still faces considerable barriers toward a more widespread application. The bayesvl R package is an open program, designed for implementing Bayesian modeling and analysis using the Stan language’s no-U-turn (NUTS) sampler. The package combines the ability to construct Bayesian network models using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation technique, and the graphic capability of the ggplot2 package. As a result, it can improve the user experience and intuitive understanding when constructing and analyzing Bayesian network models. A case example is offered to illustrate the usefulness of the package for Big Data analytics and cognitive computing."

Two of its dimensions include how unevenly members are distributed—i.e., configurational imbalance—and the extent to which members work in isolation from other team members—i.e., configurational isolation. We examine the combined influence of configurational dispersion, information and communication technologies (ICTs) use, and leader coaching on team performance mediated by interpersonal process asymmetry. The model is tested via a year-long field study of 88 teams and their leaders with members dispersed across China, India, and the United States. Results show that leaders should minimize their coaching when configurationally isolated teams use synchronous ICTs and when configurationally imbalanced teams use asynchronous ICTs."
2025,Empowering Community Health Workers With Scripted Medicine: Design Science Research Study,Dario Staehelin and Damaris Schmid and Felix Gerber and Mateusz Dolata and Gerhard Schwabe,https://doi.org/10.2196/57545,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2292949525000963,,,,"Background
The World Health Organization anticipates a shortage of 14 million health workers by 2030, particularly affecting the Global South. Community health workers (CHWs) may mitigate the shortages of professional health care workers. Recent studies have explored the feasibility and effectiveness of shifting noncommunicable disease (NCD) services to CHWs. Challenges, such as high attrition rates and variable performance, persist due to inadequate organizational support and could hamper such efforts. Research on employee empowerment highlights how organizational structures affect employees’ perception of empowerment and retention.
Objective
This study aims to develop Scripted Medicine to empower CHWs to accept broader responsibilities in NCD care. It aims to convey relevant medical and counseling knowledge through medical algorithms and ThinkLets (ie, social scripts). Collaboration engineering research offers insights that could help address the structural issues in community-based health care and facilitate task shifting.
Methods
This study followed a design science research approach to implement a mobile health–supported, community-based intervention in 2 districts of Lesotho. We first developed the medical algorithms and ThinkLets based on insights from collaboration engineering and algorithmic management literature. We then evaluated the designed approach in a field study in the ComBaCaL (Community Based Chronic Disease Care Lesotho) project. The field study included 10 newly recruited CHWs and spanned over 2 weeks of training and 12 weeks of field experience. Following an abductive approach, we analyzed surveys, interviews, and observations to study how Scripted Medicine empowers CHWs to accept broader responsibilities in NCD care.
Results
Scripted Medicine successfully conveyed the required medical and counseling knowledge through medical algorithms and ThinkLets. We found that medical algorithms predominantly influenced CHWs’ perception of structural empowerment, while ThinkLets affected their psychological empowerment. The different perceptions between the groups of CHWs from the 2 districts highlighted the importance of considering the cultural and economic context.
Conclusions
We propose Scripted Medicine as a novel approach to CHW empowerment inspired by collaboration engineering and algorithmic management. Scripted Medicine broadens the perspective on mobile health–supported, community-based health care. It emphasizes the need to script not only essential medical knowledge but also script counseling expertise. These scripts allow CHWs to embed medical knowledge into the social interactions in community-based health care. Scripted Medicine empowers CHW to accept broader responsibilities to address the imminent shortage of medical professionals in the Global South."
2023,Perceptions of client stories in internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy: A mixed-methods evaluation,Heather D. Hadjistavropoulos and Taylor G. Hill and Aaron E. Philipp-Muller and Blake Dear and Nick Titov,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2023.100692,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782923000921,,,,"Internet-delivered Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (ICBT) aims to support people with mental health concerns using online treatment materials. Client stories (either real or a composite based on many clients) are often used in ICBT to facilitate learning. However, these stories remain understudied in terms of how they are perceived by clients, as well as their relationship to ICBT engagement, satisfaction, and outcomes. Among a sample of 324 clients enrolled in transdiagnostic ICBT targeting symptoms of depression and anxiety, we examined client perceptions of stories through mixed-method qualitative (open-ended) and quantitative (closed-ended) data collection. Specifically, 234 (72.22 %) clients responded to questions about stories at 4 weeks and 221 (68.21 %) responded to questions at 8 weeks. Most clients who responded to questions endorsed reviewing at least some stories (79.06 % at 4 weeks, 71.95 % at 8 weeks). Moreover, they rated stories positively in terms of being relatable, making clients feel less alone, increasing knowledge, providing ideas for how to use skills, and motivating clients to use skills. These perceptions of stories remained stable over the course of treatment. Stories were perceived more positively among those with lower symptom severity at 8 weeks as well as those who were more satisfied with ICBT at 8 weeks. Story perceptions at 4 weeks were predictive of decreased post-treatment anxiety symptom severity but not depression while controlling for baseline scores, age, and education. 26.49 % of clients at 4 weeks who reviewed stories and 33.33 % at 8 weeks provided suggestions about how to improve stories. In a qualitative analysis, we found 5 categories of suggestions including increasing the variety of issues and relatability of stories, ensuring the stories are realistic, refining the formatting, and making the stories shorter. Overall, this study provides insights into how client stories could be improved to play a more significant role in future ICBT programs."

While previous research on sentiment analysis has shifted from analyzing single data types to incorporating multimodal data, current studies face certain limitations. These include overlooking the impact of redundant information within feature sequences of each modality, failing to account for the complementarity between modality data, and neglecting the varying significance of different modalities in conveying sentiments. This paper introduces a sentiment analysis framework designed for text information enhancement and multimodal feature fusion. The text modality is central to this framework, around which an attention mechanism augments emotional correlations between modalities. An expanded sentiment lexicon refines the representation of multimodal features, thus capturing emotional information more accurately. Experimental evaluations conducted on two standard datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, show that the accuracy of the proposed method in multimodal emotion recognition tasks reaches 85.7% and 85.8% respectively, at 1.6% and 1.8% higher than the baseline methods. Thus, it demonstrates robust regression and classification performance."

The objective of the study is to investigate the attitude of university students about the use of E-learning based on the Technology Acceptance Model. This research is to analyze the relationship of university students’ intention to use e-learning with three antecedents include attitude, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. A survey method was used to 151 students by using a questionnaire as a tool. Participants were selected using random sampling. The informed consent was obtained from participants as for ethical consideration. Findings indicated that attitude was a significant predictor towards student's intention to use E-Learning. As a result, it is seen that students’ attitude plays an important role in contributing to the intention to use e-learning system. The outcome of this study is expected to improve and upgraded E-learning system to be beneficial according to the needs of the students."

However, there is a dearth of research that examined how decision-making involving various moral foundations in video games can influence players' intergroup perceptions. Therefore, this study examined how players’ in-game decisions with respect to the six moral foundations and interactions with different non-player characters’ (NPCs’) identities influenced their attitudes toward outgroup foreign immigrants. A 2 (video game scenarios: moral choices vs. non-moral choices) by 3 (NPCs’ nationality: all citizens vs. citizens and foreigners vs. all foreigners) experiment was conducted (N = 300). There was no main interaction effect across conditions. Participants who interacted with only citizen NPCs reported significantly more positive post-game attitudes toward immigrants than those who interacted with both citizen and foreigner characters. Participants who violated the care/harm, ingroup/loyalty, and liberty/oppression foundations experienced higher levels of guilt, but this had no impact on their immigrant attitudes. However, those who violated the fairness/reciprocity and liberty/oppression foundations reported poorer intergroup attitudes. Implications of the findings are discussed."

These methods consider the underlying semantic meanings of text to perform different tasks such as Twitter sentiment analysis (assigning positive, negative, or neutral sentiment to Tweets). CBSA is superior to traditional statistical methods for accurately discovering sentiment labels. Due to a limited knowledge base, these methods are unable to identify the sentiment polarity of all kinds of text. Therefore, supervised learning techniques are mostly ensembled with CBSA methods to classify the whole text. These techniques require labeled data. It is a tedious and time-consuming task due to the manually labeling of large datasets (Such as Twitter datasets). Therefore, an unsupervised learning mechanism can be a better alternative to solve this problem. In this paper, a novel unsupervised learning framework based on Concept-based and hierarchical clustering is proposed for Twitter sentiment analysis. Popular hierarchical clustering methods including single linkage, complete linkage, and average linkage algorithms are ensembled serially. Two different feature representation methods including Boolean and Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) are investigated. We have also experimented with Well-known classifiers (Naive Bayes, Neural Network) for a fair comparison. Accuracy measure (proportion of correct predictions) is used to evaluate the performance of understudied techniques. It is empirically shown that the performance of unsupervised learning techniques is comparable with supervised learning techniques."

A pre/post experimental design was carried out with 82 first-level students of the Technical University of Ambato in the careers of Systems and Electronics. The results revealed that 45% of the students increased their levels of application and analysis in programming processes. In addition, the research revealed that students who come from a background other than computer science agree with the integration of online programming tools from the first level of university entrance since this method helps to improve their learning capacity."

Another aim is to understand the specific behavior presented by students bystanders, namely whether they noticed incidents of cyberbullying and interpreted these events as an emergency and which actions they determined as being appropriate in providing assistance. Following a cross-cultural perspective to reach these aims, a total of 788 Portuguese and Brazilian college students answered to the Cyberbullying Inventory for College Students. Moderation analysis revealed that intervening moderated the relationship between being the bystander of cyberbullying and being the victim and/or aggressor. A three-way interaction showed that this relationship was stronger in Brazilian students, revealing that the bystanders who were inactive were more likely to also become a victim or an aggressor themselves, whereas those who intervened were less likely to become a victim or an aggressor. Implications for future research and interventive action are discussed."

To do so, a sample of 113 EFL students was chosen from a national university in central China. Following that, through a random sampling method, students were allocated to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group (N = 57) was instructed through three AI-driven chatbots, whereas the control group (N = 56) received regular instructions without using AI-driven chatbots. To evaluate participants' level of academic engagement, a self-report scale was administered to them before and after the intervention. The study results indicated that the AI-driven chatbots positively influenced the academic engagement of students in Chinese EFL classrooms. Put it another way, the study outcomes revealed that AI-driven chatbots served as an important role in fostering Chinese EFL students’ behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. The results of this intervention study may be illuminating for all language teachers working in L2 instructional contexts. Concerning the outcomes of this inquiry, AI-driven chatbots could be of great help to language teachers in enhancing the academic engagement of their students."

However, existing studies on flavor-based research often treat Chinese dishes from various regions as a single entity, resulting in biases when examining regional distinctions and the variety of recipes. To explore the potential correlation between food ingredients and regions, this paper performs flavor analysis and region prediction for Chinese typical dishes. A new dataset including 1534 recipes combined with a compound-ingredient list to construct a compound-ingredient-recipe network. The results indicate that in terms of food ingredient selection, Hainan shows the highest degree of flavor compound sharing, while Shanghai does the lowest. While all the regions studied tend to exhibit negative food pairing according to the food pairing hypothesis, a region with a high degree of flavor sharing is more able to become prominent representation of the corresponding flavor branch through the analysis of representative ingredients. Across the 14 regions studied, the frequency of ingredient usage within a region plays a crucial role in maintaining its distinct flavor profile. Concerning the individual contributions of ingredients to flavor compound sharing, the positive contributions are linked to rice and natural spices, including Welsh onion, ginger, and garlic, while the negative contributions are primarily associated with flour, pork, and traditional Chinese condiments such as soy sauce, cooking wine, and grain vinegar. Multiple deep learning experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of combining ingredient and flavor information to region prediction for recipes."

This paper proposes a Structure-Aware Graph Convolutional Neural Network (SA-GNN) model for CSLR. This model constructs a spatial–temporal scene graph, explicitly capturing motion units’ spatial structure and temporal variation. Furthermore, to effectively train the SA-GNN, we propose an adaptive bootstrap strategy that enhances weak supervision using dense pseudo labels. This strategy incorporates a confidence cross-entropy loss to adjust the distribution of pseudo labels adaptively. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive results on popular CSLR datasets."

Previous efforts have made strides in identifying and reducing toxicity; however, a unified and adaptable framework for managing toxic content across diverse online discourse remains essential. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework RESPECT designed to effectively identify and mitigate toxicity in online conversations. The framework comprises two components: an encoder-only model for detecting toxicity and a decoder-only model for generating debiased versions of the text. By leveraging the capabilities of transformer-based models, toxicity is addressed as a binary classification problem. Subsequently, open-source and proprietary large language models are utilized through prompt-based approaches to rewrite toxic text into non-toxic, and making sure these are contextually accurate alternatives. Empirical results demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces toxicity across various conversational styles, fostering safer and more respectful communication in online environments."

This paper introduces an original set of student profiles specific to online courses, and it does so by means of data mining and supervised learning. We use the responses from an online questionnaire to gather detailed opinion from 632 students from Romania regarding the advantages and disadvantages of MOOCs, as well as the reasons for not joining online courses. Based on the extracted statistics, we present six decision trees for classifying the finalization and participation rates of online courses based on the students individual traits. Furthermore, we discuss these profiles and explain the implications of this study. We believe our findings to bring consistent novelty both in understanding the needs of modern students, as well as in optimizing the way eLearning is further developed."

The program provided a sample of students between the ages of 15 to 18 a laptop and their household’s free access to unlimited broadband internet for up to two years. The digitally excluded are typically framed as lacking in abilities and access (Thomas et al., 2019), and as those for whom the costs of digital inclusion are too high to achieve (Ogle and Musolino, 2016, Ogle, 2017). Rarely, if ever, are those in low income households or those considered to be digitally marginalised imagined to also live in smart homes. Using experiences described in our data, we show how the uses of smart home technologies in these low-income households fit and contradict current understandings of both smart homes and digital inclusion; and contribute understandings of how those in low-income households experience automated technologies through the intersection of social and economic infrastructures."

We pose that the availability of computing and telecommunications infrastructure, highly converging devices for Internet access and content suited to the population needs and idiosyncrasies are not enough to accomplish long-term socioeconomic development. This paper suggests that non technology-centric programs are necessary to effectively achieve sustainable digital inclusion projects, particularly in remote and underserved populations. This new perspective, encompassing strategies for social action with grass roots participation including technology adoption programs and a strong component of moral leadership may contribute to turn ICT into successful development engines. Furthermore, we argue that the confluence of Digital Convergence with social and environmental phenomena is creating new divides whose multifactorial nature can be analyzed using the principles of complex adaptive systems."
2019,Are smartphones really that bad? Improving the psychological measurement of technology-related behaviors,David A. Ellis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563219300986,,,,"Understanding how people use technology remains important, particularly when measuring the impact this might have on individuals and society. To date, research within psychological science often frames new technology as problematic with overwhelmingly negative consequences. However, this paper argues that the latest generation of psychometric tools, which aim to assess smartphone usage, are unable to capture technology related experiences or behaviors. As a result, many conclusions concerning the psychological impact of technology use remain unsound. Current assessments have also failed to keep pace with new methodological developments and these data-intensive approaches challenge the notion that smartphones and related technologies are inherently problematic. The field should now consider how it might re-position itself conceptually and methodologically given that many ‘addictive’ technologies have long since become intertwined with daily life."

A new classification of workplace areas is used in combination with an established official classification of residential areas. The approach is demonstrated using an empirical analysis of 26 million commuting flows in England and Wales, measured between the smallest residential and workplace areas in the 2011 census. The analysis demonstrates potential insights to be gained by this approach, revealing clear patterns in the structure of travel to work flows between geodemographic clusters. Our broad approach is not limited to use in specific countries and has potential application for use with data from non-census sources."

2025,Chapter 18 - Nursing in the digital age: the importance of health technology and its advancement in nursing and healthcare,Susannah Jonathan,https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-443-22270-2.00018-6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443222702000186,Academic Press,Digital Technology in Public Health and Rehabilitation Care,Raymond K.Y. Tong and Balasankar Ganesan,"Healthcare has undergone significant changes in recent decades to incorporate new technology and meet evolving needs of the people and the community. This shift has replaced traditional methods like prescription pads and patient charts with digital screens and software. The adoption of these advancements has had a positive impact on patient outcomes and the number of lives saved. It has been recognized that healthcare, including nursing, is experiencing transformative changes due to the presence of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics systems. These digital technologies have a profound global influence on nursing, emphasizing the importance for nurses to excel both clinically and technologically. Virtual reality (VR) is a form of simulation that utilizes advanced equipment and augmented reality (AR) interventions. VR simulations offer nursing students a valuable opportunity to practice high-risk interventions on virtual patients, allowing them to gain experience without posing any risk to patient safety. AR holds significant promise in the field of education, particularly in medical and nursing education. This is due to its unique capability to seamlessly blend virtual objects with the real world, enhancing simulations and creating a more realistic and immersive learning experience. By integrating virtual elements into the physical reality of users, AR has the potential to revolutionize medical and nursing education by providing students with hands-on interactive training opportunities that closely resemble real-life scenarios. This technology can enhance the understanding and retention of complex medical and nursing concepts, improve diagnostic skills, and facilitate practical learning in a safe and controlled environment. The integration of AR in medical and nursing education has the potential to greatly benefit students and ultimately contribute to the advancement of healthcare. Computer-assisted procedures and surgeries have taken its place in healthcare industry. With the increasing prevalence of robotic surgery, surgeons are faced with the challenge of enhancing and maintaining their skills while ensuring patient safety. Robotic surgery offers several advantages, including faster recovery times, lower complication rates, reduced blood loss, and the restoration of site-specific functions. In addition, telehealth and health informatics have been well accepted in the healthcare industry which assist in delivering various healthcare services remotely. Telehealth includes remote patient monitoring, interventions, education, patient follow-ups, data collection, pain management, and innovative care approaches. One emerging role for nurses in telehealth is telephone triage, which utilizes electronic information and communication technologies to provide healthcare support when distance separates the participants. Through telehealth, nurses excel in providing long-term wellness, self-management, and remote healthcare for their patients which involves offering consultations and treatments using digital platforms. Health informatics refers to the application of the information technologies in the healthcare field to enhance healthcare and overall health of the population. With advancements in technology, the collection, analysis, and utilization of healthcare data have become more effective. In nursing practice, informatics has had a significant impact on documentation. Traditional methods such as paper charts and handwritten notes have been replaced by easily accessible electronic health records and other systems that store and update patients’ medical history. Through electronic charting, nurses can access information and utilize it to improve patient care. Additionally, these medical records can be accessed by all medical professionals involved in the patient’s care, both internally and externally. Health informatics also assists nurses in providing the best possible care by tracking staff shortages, workflow, and facilitating communication within the team to enhance processes without experiencing burnout. Determining the most effective evidence-based practices also involves the use of health informatics, as analyzing collected data on patient care and outcomes helps determine the best care for future patients. Evolution of digital health impacts the future of our healthcare industry."

The objective of this paper is to virtually construct three types of teams: innovative, knowledge, and quality based on Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) profile scores. These scores measure how people process information and provide measurement of the strength of the four quadrants of the brain each having different characteristics. These types of teams require different composition of team members using their profile scores in order to achieve their respective aims. Innovative teams deal with the whole organizations as a one unit and may question all underlying assumption; knowledge teams span multiple functions; quality teams addressed issues in a silo function. A prototype is developed to construct teams from an actual data base of employee profiles in a developing nation. A user may request one of the three types of teams, state duration in time, and displays the selected members with their respective profile scores of the four quadrants. The teams formed maybe used in software development teams as well as business plan teams. These team constructs should foster and nurture innovative idea generation and maintain the competitive advantage of global organizations."

Therefore, we propose a permutation based XLNet fine-tuning model for aspect category detection and sentiment polarity detection. Our model learns bidirectional contexts via positional encoding and factorization order. We evaluate the proposed permutation language model on three ABSA datasets, namely, SentiHood, SemEval 2015, and SemEval 2016. Specifically, we studied the ABSA tasks in a constrained system with a multi-class environment. Our result indicates that the proposed permutation language model achieves a better result."

There has been a rise in natural language processing (NLP) communities across the African continent (Masakhane, AfricaNLP workshops). With this momentum noted, and given the existing power asymmetries that plague the African continent, there is an urgent need to ensure that these technologies move toward shared goals between organizations and stakeholders, not only to improve the representation of African languages in cutting-edge NLP research but also to ensure that NLP research enables technological advances toward human dignity, well-being, and equity for those who speak African languages. This study investigates the motivations, focus, and challenges faced by various stakeholders who are at the core of the NLP process. We perform structured stakeholder identification to identify core stakeholders in the NLP process. Interviews with representatives of these stakeholder groups are performed and are collated into relevant themes. Finally, a set of recommendations are proposed for use by policy and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers."

This problem may be particularly acute when a subordinate must bypass their direct manager because the manager engages in a wrongful effort to suppress the bad news, which is the context for our study. In this research, we examine the impacts of organizational commitment, interpersonal closeness, and Confucian ethics on individuals’ willingness to report bad news that is deliberately hidden from upper management and we do this in the Chinese culture context. Based on data collected from 158 Chinese software engineers, we found that organizational commitment positively affects individuals’ willingness to report, while interpersonal closeness with the wrongdoer negatively affects willingness to report. With respect to the influence of Confucian ethics, our findings suggest that: (1) individuals’ ethical disposition toward loyalty between sovereign and subject (interpreted in this research as loyalty to one's organization) strengthens the positive effect of organizational commitment on willingness to report, and (2) individuals’ ethical disposition on trust between friends strengthens the negative effect of interpersonal closeness with the wrongdoer on willingness to report."
2023,Democratizing the Development of Chatbots to Improve Public Health: Feasibility Study of COVID-19 Misinformation,Leigh Powell and Radwa Nour and Randa Sleibi and Hanan {Al Suwaidi} and Nabil Zary,https://doi.org/10.2196/43120,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S229294952300127X,,,,"Background
Chatbots enable users to have humanlike conversations on various topics and can vary widely in complexity and functionality. An area of research priority in chatbots is democratizing chatbots to all, removing barriers to entry, such as financial ones, to help make chatbots a possibility for the wider global population to improve access to information, help reduce the digital divide between nations, and improve areas of public good (eg, health communication). Chatbots in this space may help create the potential for improved health outcomes, potentially alleviating some of the burdens on health care providers and systems to be the sole voices of outreach to public health.
Objective
This study explored the feasibility of developing a chatbot using approaches that are accessible in low- and middle-resource settings, such as using technology that is low cost, can be developed by nonprogrammers, and can be deployed over social media platforms to reach the broadest-possible audience without the need for a specialized technical team.
Methods
This study is presented in 2 parts. First, we detailed the design and development of a chatbot, VWise, including the resources used and development considerations for the conversational model. Next, we conducted a case study of 33 participants who engaged in a pilot with our chatbot. We explored the following 3 research questions: (1) Is it feasible to develop and implement a chatbot addressing a public health issue with only minimal resources? (2) What is the participants’ experience with using the chatbot? (3) What kinds of measures of engagement are observed from using the chatbot?
Results
A high level of engagement with the chatbot was demonstrated by the large number of participants who stayed with the conversation to its natural end (n=17, 52%), requested to see the free online resource, selected to view all information about a given concern, and returned to have a dialogue about a second concern (n=12, 36%).
Conclusions
This study explored the feasibility of and the design and development considerations for a chatbot, VWise. Our early findings from this initial pilot suggest that developing a functioning and low-cost chatbot is feasible, even in low-resource environments. Our results show that low-resource environments can enter the health communication chatbot space using readily available human and technical resources. However, despite these early indicators, many limitations exist in this study and further work with a larger sample size and greater diversity of participants is needed. This study represents early work on a chatbot in its virtual infancy. We hope this study will help provide those who feel chatbot access may be out of reach with a useful guide to enter this space, enabling more democratized access to chatbots for all."
2017,A Framework for the Study of Complex mHealth Interventions in Diverse Cultural Settings,Marion A Maar and Karen Yeates and Nancy Perkins and Lisa Boesch and Diane Hua-Stewart and Peter Liu and Jessica Sleeth and Sheldon W Tobe,https://doi.org/10.2196/mhealth.7044,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2291522217001127,,,,"Background
To facilitate decision-making capacity between options of care under real-life service conditions, clinical trials must be pragmatic to evaluate mobile health (mHealth) interventions under the variable conditions of health care settings with a wide range of participants. The mHealth interventions require changes in the behavior of patients and providers, creating considerable complexity and ambiguity related to causal chains. Process evaluations of the implementation are necessary to shed light on the range of unanticipated effects an intervention may have, what the active ingredients in everyday practice are, how they exert their effect, and how these may vary among recipients or between sites.
Objective
Building on the CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile HEalth Applications and onLine TeleHealth) statement and participatory evaluation theory, we present a framework for the process evaluations for mHealth interventions in multiple cultural settings. We also describe the application of this evaluation framework to the implementation of DREAM-GLOBAL (Diagnosing hypertension—Engaging Action and Management in Getting Lower BP in Indigenous and LMIC [low- and middle-income countries]), a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT), and mHealth intervention designed to improve hypertension management in low-resource environments. We describe the evaluation questions and the data collection processes developed by us.
Methods
Our literature review revealed that there is a significant knowledge gap related to the development of a process evaluation framework for mHealth interventions. We used community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods and formative research data to develop a process evaluation framework nested within a pragmatic RCT.
Results
Four human organizational levels of participants impacted by the mHealth intervention were identified that included patients, providers, community and organizations actors, and health systems and settings. These four levels represent evaluation domains and became the core focus of the evaluation. In addition, primary implementation themes to explore in each of the domains were identified as follows: (1) the major active components of the intervention, (2) technology of the intervention, (3) cultural congruence, (4) task shifting, and (5) unintended consequences. Using the four organizational domains and their interaction with primary implementation themes, we developed detailed evaluation research questions and identified the data or information sources to best answer our questions.
Conclusions
Using DREAM-GLOBAL to illustrate our approach, we succeeded in developing an uncomplicated process evaluation framework for mHealth interventions that provide key information to stakeholders, which can optimize implementation of a pragmatic trial as well as inform scale up. The human organizational level domains used to focus the primary implementation themes in the DREAM-GLOBAL process evaluation framework are sufficiently supported in our research, and the literature and can serve as a valuable tool for other mHealth process evaluations.

Place attachment refers to the relationship between people and places, which has numerous benefits for individual well-being. Popular location-based AR games often include elements that are known to predict place attachment: exploration, social relations or the experience of enjoyment in a place. We argue that positive emotions triggered by playing can influence players’ place attachment via the process of gamification. We tested this hypothesis in a correlational study conducted among Pokémon Go players. Our analyses showed that satisfaction from playing and the social relations made during play positively predict place attachment, but the amount of time spent on playing does not. A series of mediation analyses showed that relations among game satisfaction, social relations, and place attachment were mediated by the appraisal of the place as exciting. This study demonstrated a mechanism of emotional transfer between positive experiences from playing and place attachment, which may prove useful in other domains, such as education, land conservation, or marketing."

Using data generated by the author’s enterprise vendor–based electronic health record, the enterprise analytics software, and expertise from a dedicated group of informaticists, physicians, and analysts, the authors developed an opioid scorecard that was released on a quarterly basis via email to all opioid prescribers at our institution. These scorecards compare providers’ opioid prescribing habits on the basis of established metrics to those of their peers within their specialty throughout the enterprise.
Results
At the time of this study’s completion, 2034 providers have received at least 1 scorecard over a 5-quarter period ending in September 2021. Poisson regression demonstrated a 1.6% quarterly reduction in opioid prescribing, and chi-square analysis demonstrated pre-post reductions in the proportion of prescriptions longer than 5 days’ duration and a morphine equivalent daily dose of >50.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first peer comparison effort with high-quality evidence-based metrics of this scale published in the literature. By sharing this process for designing the metrics and the process of distribution, the authors hope to influence other health systems to attempt to curb the opioid pandemic through peer comparison. Future research examining the effects of this intervention could demonstrate significant reductions in opioid prescribing, thus potentially reducing the progression of individual patients to opioid use disorder and the associated increased risk of morbidity and mortality."

2024,Which storytelling people prefer? Mapping news topic and news engagement in social media,Xuejin Jiang and Liming Liu and Biying Wu-Ouyang and Long Chen and Han Lin,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2024.108248,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756322400116X,,,,"Nations engage in a nuanced competition to achieve soft power through social media on a global scale. Exploring the intricate dynamics, research endeavors focus on unraveling the mechanisms by which national media endeavors not only captivate a diverse international audience but also amplify their influence through carefully crafted narratives. However, extant research falls short in both theoretical and empirical examinations of the intricate interplay between news content and news engagement. This research examines in depth the news content strategy employed by China's national media for global communication, focusing on 6632 YouTube videos of CGTN (China Global Television Network) from May 2021 to August 2023. Specifically, utilizing BERTopic machine learning techniques, we identified 16 distinct news topics and associated with news engagement metrics (e.g., number of views, likes, and comments). Our results reveal a pattern of selective engagement and avoidance by international audiences, particularly in their significant interest in geopolitical and technological topics, while showing less interest in Chinese cultural and social news. This study offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of national media's digital storytelling strategy, shedding light on audience preferences and areas for potential recalibration in content dissemination."
2017,When is computer-mediated intergroup contact most promising? Examining the effect of out-group members' anonymity on prejudice,Sandy Schumann and Olivier Klein and Karen Douglas and Miles Hewstone,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.08.006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563217304739,,,,"Computer-mediated intergroup contact (CMIC) is a valuable strategy to reduce negative sentiments towards members of different social groups. We examined whether characteristics of communication media that facilitate intergroup encounters shape its effect on out-group attitudes. Specifically, we propose that concealing individuating cues about out-group members during CMIC increases prejudice, as interaction partners are perceived as less socially present. To assess these hypotheses, we conducted two mixed-factorial experiments. Participants engaged in synchronous text-chat with out-group members (Study 1) and a confederate (Study 2) who either shared or concealed their name and photo. Overall, CMIC reduced negative out-group sentiments. Study 2 showed, however, that out-group members' anonymity decreased perceived social presence, which was associated with less positive evaluations of the CMIC and higher prejudice. In conclusion, CMIC can contribute to conflict resolution interventions, preparing individuals for direct intergroup contact, if its affordances or conversation topics enhance interaction partners' social presence."
2024,Analysis of Strategic Marketing in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises: Case of the Bakery Industry in Colombia,Harold Bernardo Sukier and Martha Garcia Samper and Reynier Israel Ramirez Molina and Michael Sandoval Karam and Diego Baez Palencia and Nathan Polo Ibanez and Mauricio Junior Santamaria Ruiz,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2023.12.178,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050923021907,,,,"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are in a competitive system. The objective of the research was to analyze strategic marketing in SMEs in the bakery industry in the city of Barranquilla, for which a hypothesis is presented on the positive relationship between consumer behavior in relation to marketing strategies. Due to this, a categorical regression model was performed to test the hypotheses. The results showed that the industry analysis is more relevant for those companies that adopt a mature market strategy. The analysis of consumer buying behavior and the analysis of market demand dynamics prevail in the new markets strategy. Although product differentiation to achieve positioning is an important driver for companies that use growth market strategies, it is concluded that the consumer buying behavior hypothesis is valid because the analysis allows implementing differentiation actions that are included in strategic control, which is a complex thought process developed by top management."
2020,Content and Quality of Infant Feeding Smartphone Apps: Five-Year Update on a Systematic Search and Evaluation,Heilok Cheng and Alison Tutt and Catherine Llewellyn and Donna Size and Jennifer Jones and Sarah Taki and Chris Rossiter and Elizabeth Denney-Wilson,https://doi.org/10.2196/17300,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2291522220003496,,,,"Background
Parents use apps to access information on child health, but there are no standards for providing evidence-based advice, support, and information. Well-developed apps that promote appropriate infant feeding and play can support healthy growth and development. A 2015 systematic assessment of smartphone apps in Australia about infant feeding and play found that most apps had minimal information, with poor readability and app quality.
Objective
This study aimed to systematically evaluate the information and quality of smartphone apps providing information on breastfeeding, formula feeding, introducing solids, or infant play for consumers.
Methods
The Google Play store and Apple App Store were searched for free and paid Android and iPhone Operating System (iOS) apps using keywords for infant feeding, breastfeeding, formula feeding, and tummy time. The apps were evaluated between September 2018 and January 2019 for information content based on Australian guidelines, app quality using the 5-point Mobile App Rating Scale, readability, and suitability of health information.
Results
A total of 2196 unique apps were found and screened. Overall, 47 apps were evaluated, totaling 59 evaluations for apps across both the Android and iOS platforms. In all, 11 apps had affiliations to universities and health services as app developers, writers, or editors. Furthermore, 33 apps were commercially developed. The information contained within the apps was poor: 64% (38/59) of the evaluations found no or low coverage of information found in the Australian guidelines on infant feeding and activity, and 53% (31/59) of the evaluations found incomplete or incorrect information with regard to the depth of information provided. Subjective app assessment by health care practitioners on whether they would use, purchase, or recommend the app ranged from poor to acceptable (median 2.50). Objective assessment of the apps’ engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information was scored as acceptable (median 3.63). The median readability score for the apps was at the American Grade 8 reading level. The suitability of health information was rated superior or adequate for content, reading demand, layout, and interaction with the readers.
Conclusions
The quality of smartphone apps on infant feeding and activity was moderate based on the objective measurements of engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information from a reliable source. The overall quality of information on infant feeding and activity was poor, indicated by low coverage of topics and incomplete or partially complete information. The key areas for improvement involved providing evidence-based information consistent with the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council’s Infant Feeding Guidelines. Apps supported and developed by health care professionals with adequate health service funding can ensure that parents are provided with credible and reliable resources."
2022,Design of a serious games to improve resilience skills in youngsters,Raquel Menendez-Ferreira and Javier Torregrosa and Daniel López-Fernández and Jesus Mayor,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcom.2021.100462,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952121000598,,,,"Nowadays, extremist ideologies are increasing their presence around the world, while having an impact on different social fields, such as politics, religion, or even sports. Youngsters are especially vulnerable to this type of ideologies, as they are still conforming to their own ideals, which in turn represents a problem on their moral and ethical development. While today there exist many programs and projects which focus on confronting this problem, most of them focused in psychological protective factors, it is still necessary to adapt these methodologies to the new characteristics of society and attract the interest of young people. In this research, we present the design and pilot testing of YoungRes, a serious game focused on promoting resilience skills. This paper describes the theoretical foundations of the intervention, its development as a serious game, and its validation in pilot testing made by educators, psychologists, and psycho-pedagogues. The pilot testing is conducted through the trial of educators of the first two video game sessions. After that, they reported feedback on their opinions about the game, together with suggestions and measures about the impact it could have for educational purposes."

Ravishankar,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2023.103903,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720623001519,,,,"Unlike emergent brokers, formal brokers are appointed to mediate information exchanges in a highly structured setting. While the use of formal brokers has increased, particularly in globally distributed work, the extant literature has so far paid little attention to the information brokering challenges they face. Our case analysis revealed that, despite the structured setting, information users often bypass brokers and exchange information directly, also known as a workaround, thus disrupting the brokering process. In this scenario, the broker is displaced and is not able to broker. Our findings suggest that formal brokers do not necessarily reassume their brokering role once workarounds are detected. Instead, they first assess the conditions that led to the workarounds and the impact (positive or negative) on the information exchange network. Should the impact be negative, formal brokers regain their brokering role by deploying protective actions. However, a positive impact on the information exchange network allow brokers to maintain a nonbrokering position, thus passively allowing connecting actions to resume. We describe three practices that formal brokers pursue when workarounds are present and conclude by outlining the contributions to research and practice."

Research has found that perceived competence and perceived warmth mediate the impact of two parasocial relationships, ""assistant"" and ""friend"", on consumer attitudes. Compared with the ""friend"" type of human-machine parasocial relationship, the ""assistant"" type of human-machine parasocial relationship significantly enhances consumers' perceived competence; Compared with the ""assistant"" type of human-machine parasocial relationship, the ""friend"" type of human-machine parasocial relationship significantly enhances consumers' perceived warmth. Meanwhile, research has demonstrated the moderate role of gender traits in artificial intelligence robots. This study broadens the research perspective of AI Services marketing, and provides important enlightenment for enterprises to develop Marketing strategy and AI Intelligent design."
2020,Development of a Living Lab for a Mobile-Based Health Program for Korean-Chinese Working Women in South Korea: Mixed Methods Study,Youlim Kim and Hyeonkyeong Lee and Mi Kyung Lee and Hyeyeon Lee and Hyoeun Jang,https://doi.org/10.2196/15359,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2291522220000029,,,,"Background
Korean-Chinese (KC) women make up the largest group of female migrants in South Korea. To prevent and manage chronic diseases in middle-aged KC women working full time, it is necessary to develop health promotion programs that utilize an online platform because such a platform would allow individuals to participate in health promotion interventions at their convenience.
Objective
This study aimed to develop a living lab for a mobile-based health (LLm Health) program focused on improving the physical activity and cultural adaptation of KC women workers.
Methods
We used a mixed methods design. Living lab principles were factored into the LLm Health program, including the use of multiple methods, user engagement, multistakeholder participants, real-life settings, and cocreation. The program was developed using the 4 steps of the intervention mapping method: needs assessment, setting of objectives, identification of intervention strategies, and intervention design. Needs assessment was conducted through a literature review, focus group interviews with a total of 16 middle-aged KC women, and an online survey related to health promotion of migrant workers given to 38 stakeholders. KC middle-aged women participated in the early stages of program development and provided the idea of developing programs and mobile apps to enhance physical activity and acculturation. The mobile app developed in the program was validated with the help of 12 KC women and 4 experts, including 3 nursing professors and a professor of physical education. They were asked to rate each item based on content, interface design, and technology on a 4-point scale using a 23-item Smartphone App Evaluation Tool for Health Care.
Results
The LLm Health program comprised a 24-week walking program using Fitbit devices, the mobile app, and social cognitive interventions. The mobile app contained 6 components: a step counter, an exercise timer, an online chat function, health information, level of cardiovascular risk, and health status. The cultural aspects and lifestyles of KC women were accommodated in the entire process of program development. The content validity of the mobile app was found to be 0.90 and 0.96 according to the 12 KC women and 4 experts, respectively.
Conclusions
The mobile app was found to be valid and acceptable for KC women. The living lab approach was a useful strategy for developing a culturally adaptive LLm Health program for KC women workers, leading to their active participation in the overall research process, including needs assessment, program composition, and pre-evaluation."

However, despite the educational potential of the Metaverse, negative concerns are also emerging in virtual world. Systematic efforts are essential to effectively integrate the Metaverse, which has both educational possibilities and challenges, into the educational field. Given the Metaverse's technical complexity, safety, and ethical issues, a set of guidelines is necessary for its educational use. This chapter presents systematic guidelines for the educational use of the Metaverse. The components, steps, and details for the guidelines were identified through a review of prior studies, case study analysis, a Delphi survey with experts, and usability tests with teachers. This chapter initially provides a brief overview of the various types and examples of educational applications of the Metaverse and subsequently outlines the methodological approach undertaken to develop the guidelines. Afterwards, guidelines for the educational use of the Metaverse are presented according to the three components: Understanding and Exploration of the Educational Metaverse, Preparative Considerations for Educational Metaverse, and Implementation of Educational Metaverse. In conclusion, this chapter emphasizes that the Metaverse itself cannot bring about educational effectiveness, and the Metaverse with educational guidelines should be utilized in designing instructional realities that are hard to experience in a traditional classroom setting."

This study delves into the examination of how vendor's in-role and extra-role performance jointly impact CCBs. Employing polynomial regression and response surface analysis, this research scrutinizes the impacts of the congruence and incongruence between the vendor's in-role and extra-role performance as well as the boundary condition of environmental dynamism. The findings indicate that the CCBs are higher when in-role performance matches extra-role performance at a high level. Furthermore, when employees' in-role and extra-role performance are incongruent, CCBs decrease as the discrepancy increases. Environmental dynamism moderates these relationships."

However, such theories provide insufficient clarity on how organizations navigate the “equivocality” that arises from abundant but often unstructured and ambiguous information and signals to formulate an effective response to environmental dynamism. We address this literature gap by developing a novel organizational-sensemaking-based framework where digitally enabled strategic agility emerges from a combination of digital orientation, information governance, and digital transformation. We test the series of hypotheses depicted in the theoretical framework empirically by collecting survey data from the Australian healthcare sector. The statistical findings reveal that digital orientation influences digitally enabled strategic agility through the individual and serial mediation of information governance and digital transformation, with no direct impact observed. Our findings highlight the importance of organizational sensemaking in achieving effective responses to environmental changes, crucial for fully realizing digitally enabled strategic agility."

These facial expressions are generally categorized into two kinds such as micro and macro-expressions. To detect the macro-expression effectively, an angle based pattern extraction models and Markov models are employed. But the micro-expression delivers more detailed information than the macro-expression. Other difficulties such as short durations and rapid spontaneous facial expression are induced due to the detection and analysis of the micro-expression. To solve these challenges, we work on techniques such as Active Shape Modeling (ACM), Random Walk (RW) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which helps to improve the overall performance effectively. The key points from the facial expression over the video frames are predicted using ASM and are spatially associated with the original face through the procrustes analysis. Then RW algorithm is used to learn the training features prior to ANN model. This RW is integrated with ANN model to improve the learning performance of micro-expression with minimum computation complexity. The experimental validation on two spontaneous micro-expression datasets such as Chinese Academy of Sciences Micro-Expression (CASME) and Spontaneous Micro-expression (SMIC) over the existing SVM classifiers shows its effectiveness in automatic micro-expression learning applications."

2023,Influencing Factors to mHealth Uptake With Indigenous Populations: Qualitative Systematic Review,Andrew Goodman and Ray Mahoney and Geoffrey Spurling and Sheleigh Lawler,https://doi.org/10.2196/45162,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S229152222300044X,,,,"Background
The advancements and abundance of mobile phones and portable health devices have created an opportunity to use mobile health (mHealth) for population health systems. There is increasing evidence for the feasibility and acceptance of mHealth with Indigenous populations. Providing a synthesis of qualitative findings of mHealth with Indigenous populations will gain insights into the strengths and challenges to mHealth use in Indigenous populations.
Objective
This review aimed to identify and synthesize qualitative data pertaining to the experiences and perceptions of mHealth from the perspectives of end users (patients and service providers) living in the colonial settler democracies of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, the Pacific Islands, and the Sápmi region of northern Europe.
Methods
In May 2021, systematic searches of peer-reviewed, scientific papers were conducted across the 5 databases of PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Qualitative or mixed method studies were included where a mHealth intervention was the primary focus for responding to health challenges with Indigenous populations. Two authors independently screened papers for eligibility and assessed the risk of bias using a modified version of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. A meta-aggregative approach was used to analyze the findings of included studies.
Results
Seventeen papers met the eligibility criteria, 8 studies with patients, 7 studies with service providers, and 2 studies that included both patients and service providers. Studies were conducted in Australia (n=10), Canada (n=2), New Zealand (n=2), Papua New Guinea (n=1), the United States (n=1), and Samoa (n=1). Our interpretation of these qualitative findings shows commonalities between Indigenous patients’ and service providers’ perceptions of mHealth. We summarize our findings in six themes: (1) mHealth literacy, (2) mHealth as a facilitator for connection and support, (3) mHealth content needed to be culturally relevant, (4) mHealth security and confidentiality, (5) mHealth supporting rather than replacing service providers, and (6) workplace and organizational capacity.
Conclusions
This research suggests that mHealth can meet the needs of both patients and service providers when the mHealth intervention is culturally relevant, accounts for digital and health literacy, incorporates interactive components, is supported by workplaces, fits into health provider workflows, and meets security and confidentiality standards. Future mHealth research with Indigenous populations should partner with key representatives (eg, patients, service providers, and executive leaders) in the mHealth design appropriate to the purpose, people, setting, and delivery."

The Covid-19 pandemic, for example, has seen an unprecedented rise in UICs and illustrates how vital their success can be for positively impacting the collaborators involved and society at large. Several challenges face the successful execution of UICs, not the least of which is the cultural difference between the collaborators. Overcoming these challenges is the subject of several research initiatives that seek to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) that UIC consortiums can use to develop their internal capabilities and project management maturity. The challenges facing one large UIC have been studied in Portugal. Practitioners and researchers were involved in generating insights into how the UIC could be more effective. This paper presents some of these challenges facing the UIC and how they were addressed. It also offers early results into the CSFs deemed essential by researchers and practitioners based on their experience together over seven years. Top CSFs include senior management commitment, effective communication, stakeholder engagement, good leadership, clear and realistic goals, mutual trust and respect, interpersonal teamwork, and clear roles and responsibilities."

The Observable Performance Obstacles tool, based on the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model, was used in combination with exploratory observations during 13 surgical procedures, to identify performance obstacles created by the systemic interrelationships of medical equipment. The identification of performance obstacles is an effective way to study the accumulation of latent factors and risk hazards, and understand its implications in practice and behaviour of healthcare practitioners. In total, 123 performance obstacles were identified, of which the majority was related to environmental and organizational aspects. These findings show how the performance of nurse anaesthetists and their relation to medical equipment is continuously affected by more than user-related aspects.

We set out to investigate the features of chat messages in this particular kind of environment, assessing the amount of threading, defined in terms of message content contributing to one topic, and conversation, based on patterns in informational and emotional functions of subsequent messages. We observe that our cases are characterized with a high level of threading, even while the application did not technically support it. Furthermore, we observe patterns that demonstrate these threads were conversations, based on the types of responses in each thread. Based on our findings, we propose that technical tools for public event-based chats can support conversations and suggest that better tools for this should be developed."
2022,Accurate Forecasting of Emergency Department Arrivals With Internet Search Index and Machine Learning Models: Model Development and Performance Evaluation,Bi Fan and Jiaxuan Peng and Hainan Guo and Haobin Gu and Kangkang Xu and Tingting Wu,https://doi.org/10.2196/34504,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2291969422001776,,,,"Background
Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is a concerning global health care issue, which is mainly caused by the uncertainty of patient arrivals, especially during the pandemic. Accurate forecasting of patient arrivals can allow health resource allocation in advance to reduce overcrowding. Currently, traditional data, such as historical patient visits, weather, holiday, and calendar, are primarily used to create forecasting models. However, data from an internet search engine (eg, Google) is less studied, although they can provide pivotal real-time surveillance information. The internet data can be employed to improve forecasting performance and provide early warning, especially during the epidemic. Moreover, possible nonlinearities between patient arrivals and these variables are often ignored.
Objective
This study aims to develop an intelligent forecasting system with machine learning models and internet search index to provide an accurate prediction of ED patient arrivals, to verify the effectiveness of the internet search index, and to explore whether nonlinear models can improve the forecasting accuracy.
Methods
Data on ED patient arrivals were collected from July 12, 2009, to June 27, 2010, the period of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. These included 139,910 ED visits in our collaborative hospital, which is one of the biggest public hospitals in Hong Kong. Traditional data were also collected during the same period. The internet search index was generated from 268 search queries on Google to comprehensively capture the information about potential patients. The relationship between the index and patient arrivals was verified by Pearson correlation coefficient, Johansen cointegration, and Granger causality. Linear and nonlinear models were then developed with the internet search index to predict patient arrivals. The accuracy and robustness were also examined.
Results
All models could accurately predict patient arrivals. The causality test indicated internet search index as a strong predictor of ED patient arrivals. With the internet search index, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the linear model reduced from 5.3% to 5.0% and from 24.44 to 23.18, respectively, whereas the MAPE and RMSE of the nonlinear model decreased even more, from 3.5% to 3% and from 16.72 to 14.55, respectively. Compared with each other, the experimental results revealed that the forecasting system with extreme learning machine, as well as the internet search index, had the best performance in both forecasting accuracy and robustness analysis.
Conclusions
The proposed forecasting system can make accurate, real-time prediction of ED patient arrivals. Compared with the static traditional variables, the internet search index significantly improves forecasting as a reliable predictor monitoring continuous behavior trend and sudden changes during the epidemic (P=.002). The nonlinear model performs better than the linear counterparts by capturing the dynamic relationship between the index and patient arrivals. Thus, the system can facilitate staff planning and workflow monitoring."

One area that is under threat of extinction of local languages is Papua Province. The symptoms threat of language extinction was discovered when the researcher conducted interviews with young generation from Ngalum, Ketengban, Lepki and Arimtap tribes who studied in Jayapura, Bandung, Salatiga, Semarang and Yogyakarta, which on average they were unable to count traditional numbers even though they were fluent in local languages. This shows that having fluent regional languages do not guarantee their ability in counting traditional numbers. Therefore, the author designs in this study an android-based digital application of traditional number system for Pegunungan Bintang tribe with the aim of facilitating young generation to recognize numbers 1 to 27 in the local language of each tribe and also this study is documented for the benefit of scientific development. Testing of this application is done using blackbox testing so that the obtained result is an application that can run properly according to its function where users can use this application to recognize numbers through sound when the numbers are pressed."

El-Baz and Jasjit S. Suri,"For both neurotechnology as an engineering field and neuroethics as an academic discipline, it must be imperative to explore and address the wide implications of BCI use (and nonuse) at the aggregate level as well as the individual level. Multisystem (e.g., cross-cultural or international) considerations merit both economic and ethical consideration. Future BCI will probably has to be empowered by AI capable of anticipating, channeling, nudging, and effectively encouraging (as well as discouraging) some kinds of thoughts and choices, much like it completes queries and fulfills prompts. Unless brains are tightly geared with AI, human awareness will get left behind to be merely “on the loop” instead of “in the loop.” Hence, BCI neurotechnology could not be used in a “neutral manner” by generic consumers apart from their social surroundings and cultural traditions. Its increasing usage will generate considerable reconfiguration and disruption of extant social, economic, and power balances on the 21st century world stage. We recommend a cosmopolitan approach for neuroethics to address and potentially resolve such issues with innovations such as BCI, suggesting guidelines and regulations for transnational implementation."

In the current scenario of human development, there is a dire need to integrate spirituality into management, education, research and technology. In fact, a proper convergence of spirituality with the research performance of university teachers may lead to the development of a strong academic learning process. Since SI encompasses a multitude of the dimensions as its construct, a suitable and effective multi-criteria decision framework is proposed to measure SI. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been established as a robust multi-criteria decision-making tool and thus, will be apt for generating SI index which is termed as spiritual quotient (SQ) by considering the SI construct. An illustrative case example is also considered to show the applicability of the proposed decision framework."

The goal of this paper is to identify patterns in the development of banking products in the modern economy, which is characterized by the instability of the regulatory environment, a significant number of technological innovations in related areas, conflicting demographic trends, and an accelerated change in customer preferences. Data makes it possible to form a rather wide database of balanced panel data covering most regions of Russia over a long period (from 2010 to 2020). The results obtained indicate a fairly high quality of the regression: characteristics such as income and credit history strongly affect the volume of loans in a region (these results were expected as mentioned factors in most cases indicate a normal inertial process of changing the attitude of credit institutions and their customers to a banking product, in this case – retail lending). On the other hand, the factors characterizing the non-financial socio-demographic characteristics of the population of the regions, such as quality of health care, financial literacy, also turned out to be significant. The obtained quantitative estimates might be used for credit institutions for management of risks and product development in various territories and planning expansion."
2023,A robust hybrid machine learning model for Bengali cyber bullying detection in social media,Arnisha Akhter and Uzzal Kumar Acharjee and Md. Alamin Talukder and Md. Manowarul Islam and Md Ashraf Uddin,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlp.2023.100027,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949719123000249,,,,"Social networking platforms give users countless opportunities to share information, collaborate, and communicate positively. The same platform can be extended to a fabricated and poisonous atmosphere that gives an impersonal, harmful platform for online misuse and assault. Cyberstalking is when someone uses an internet system to ridicule, torment, insult, criticize, slander, and discredit a victim while never seeing them. With the growth of social networks, Facebook has become the online arena for bullying. Since the effects could result in a widespread contagion, it is vital to have models and mechanisms in place for the automatic identification and removal of internet cyberbullying data. This paper presents a robust hybrid ML model for cyberbullying detection in the Bengali language on social media. The Bengalibullying proposal involves an effective text preprocessing to make the Bengali text data into a useful text format, feature extraction using the TfidfVectorizer (TFID) to get the beneficial information of text data and resampling by Instance Hardness Threshold (IHT) procedure to balance the dataset to avoid overfitting or underfitting problems. In our experiment, we used the publicly available Bangla text dataset (44,001 comments) and got the highest performance ever published works on it. The model achieved the most elevated accuracy rate of 98.57% and 98.82% in binary and multilabel classification to detect cyberbullying on social media in the Bengali language. Our best performance findings are more effective than any previous effort in identifying and categorizing bullying in the Bengali language. As a result, we might use our model to correctly classify Bengali bullying in online bullying detection systems, protecting people from being the targets of social bullying."

It introduces an integrated framework designed to illuminate the interplay between these two pivotal concepts within the VR digital gaming environment. Central to this framework are distinct regulatory mechanisms that empower learners by allowing them to navigate and take control of their learning journeys. The framework interprets metacognitive processes from elements of adaptivity, control, and feedback, while exploring autonomy through the dimensions of location, formality, pedagogy, and locus of control. This framework is grounded in the recognition that enabling learners to exert control over their technologically mediated learning environments is a fundamental issue in building a language learning community. The paper not only sheds light on the theoretical underpinnings of metacognition and autonomy but also offers practical implications for their application in VR digital gaming. It delineates the evolving roles of teachers and learners within this dynamic educational landscape, highlighting how these roles are being reshaped to accommodate and leverage the affordances of VR digital gaming for enhanced language learning."

Large language models (LLMs) have shown a promising ability to generate text in response to input prompts. We use ChatGPT3.5 to automatically structure and expand medication statements in discharge summaries and thus make them easier to interpret for people and machines. Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Text Expansion (EX) are used with different prompt strategies in a zero- and few-shot setting. 100 medication statements were manually annotated and curated. NER performance was measured by using strict and partial matching. For the EX task, two experts interpreted the results by assessing semantic equivalence between original and expanded statements. The model performance was measured by precision, recall, and F1 score. For NER, the best-performing prompt reached an average F1 score of 0.94 in the test set. For EX, the few-shot prompt showed superior performance among other prompts, with an average F1 score of 0.87. Our study demonstrates good performance for NER and EX tasks in free-text medication statements using ChatGPT3.5. Compared to a zero-shot baseline, a few-shot approach prevented the system from hallucinating, which is essential when processing safety-relevant medication data. We tested ChatGPT3.5-tuned prompts on other LLMs, including ChatGPT4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, MedLM-1.5-Large, and DeepSeekV3.

In the study, explanatory mixed method design was used. As a quantitative data collection tool, the 21st century skills scale was utilized [47]. In addition to quantitative data, qualitative data were collected from the teachers and students through semi-structured interviews. Within the scope of the research, students participated in robotic design courses with Arduino over the learning management system for ten weeks and participated in a competition with their products at the end of the activity. The activity was held with the participation of 62 students and 10 teachers. The findings of the study showed that educational robotic activities caused a significant increase in the affective domain of the students. While it did not cause any significant increase in the cognitive and sociocultural domains, the average scores of students increased on post-tests compared to the pretests for these two domains. In addition, students’ 21st century skills did not differ according to gender. Although there is no statistically significant difference in pretest–posttest results due to grade level, an increase was observed in posttest averages at each grade level. The observed increase in the post-tests, although not statistical, reveals the positive effect of educational robotic coding in terms of students’ 21st century skills. To support the results of the quantitative data, the analysis of the qualitative data revealed a consensus of both teachers and students on the contribution of such applications to the advancement of contemporary skills. In conclusion, the results of this study show that educational robotic coding can be used to develop 21st century skills of elementary school students."

User-centered design processes are infrequently employed and not fully explored for building mobile health (mHealth) apps that are particularly targeted to health professionals as end users. The authors have used a user-centered design–based approach to build an mHealth app for health professionals, tasked to deliver medical laboratory-related information on a daily basis.
Objective
Our objective is to generate a simple and functional user-centered design process for mHealth apps for health professionals. This paper presents the key learnings from design activities.
Methods
A stratified random sample of doctors and nurses was recruited for the study. The design activities were planned in the following sequence: focus group discussion for situation analysis and information architecture, design activity 1 for wireframe designing, design activity 2 for wireframe testing, and user testing sessions 1 and 2.
Results
The final design and functions of the app, information architecture, and interactive elements were largely influenced by the participatory design–based user-centered design activities. As a result of the design process, we could identify the mental models of processing requests for information and personal preferences based on the experience. These findings were directly or indirectly incorporated into the app design. Furthermore, finding alternative ways of working within time constraints and cultural barriers and the methods employed to manage the challenges of interdisciplinary discourse stood out among the lessons learned.
Conclusions
We recommend a user-centered design process based on a participatory design approach in mHealth app design, enriched with focus group discussions where possible."

Morality is observed and measured during public acts or when developing and consuming products, such as movies. The Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) was developed to rigorously perform these measurements with the support of the Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD). In this paper, a Word Embedding-based Moral Foundation Assignment (WEMFA) approach has been designed, implemented, and applied to the movie domain for multiple assignment of moral foundations. WEMFA may use any dictionary, and it has been applied to a movie collection generated from movie synopses. A comparison between WEMFA and MoralStrength, the only approach found in the scientific literature, has been carried out. The proposed approach provided a percentage improvement of 41.7% with respect to the best version of MoralStrength, which uses an extension of the original MFD almost 10 times larger in number of terms. In addition, an extension of the original MFD (MFD24) has been built by adding 14 new moral foundations to the 10 original ones, enriching the moral context. WEMFA provided a mean accuracy of 78% with MFD24 despite the increment of the number of moral foundations. Besides, new extended dictionaries or even totally different ones can be used with WEMFA, since it does not need any training."

Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were used to investigate associations between PIU and substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis, misuse of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine/methamphetamine, sedatives, hallucinogens, opiates, inhalants, MDMA, other club drugs, prescription pain killers, prescription sedatives, and prescription stimulants. Among the 417,780 US college students included in our analytic cohort, 123,330 (29.52%) reported PIU. Students who demonstrated PIU had a significantly higher risk of substance misuse behaviors, including misuse of opiate, sedative, hallucinogen, club drugs, and inhalant, illicit use of prescription pain killers, and SUD diagnosis, than their peers who did not demonstrate patterns of PIU. These findings highlight the need to promote the physical, social, and emotional wellbeing of students more effectively by considering PIU in prevention and intervention efforts aimed to decrease the prevalence of addictive behaviors in US college settings."

However, thus far, such impact has been mainly framed in terms of human choice manipulation and privacy infringements, while the ethical issue of human freedom of choice in predictive MLAs has been poorly explored per se. This chapter aims to fill this gap and provide a systematic ethical inquiry into the impact raised by predictive MLAs on the preconditions underlying the exercise of freedom of choice, online and beyond. To this aim, we first pursue an ethical inquiry into the preconditions securing at a minimum threshold human freedom of choice, drawing insights on main theories developed both in moral philosophy and in sociopolitical philosophy. Then, we analyze how MLAs are governing and reshaping the contexts in which we both prepare and make our choices. We show how by doing so MLAs negatively affect the preconditions of our freedom of choice and the risks such impact raises in the short and long term, at the individual and collective level. Finally, we address such risks and highlight how our ethical inquiry helps pinpointing some key ethical criteria that ought to be considered and operationalized to secure our freedom of choice as a fundamental ethical-normative value in our contemporary MLA-driven societies."

We manipulated the usage context of these systems and tested the effects with two independent variables: the status of the system agent and the valence of the agent's feedback. As a result, this study revealed that users' satisfaction and intention for prosocial behavior increased after they experienced the shared value system based on the concept of self-preferential value. Interaction effects were also found between the status of the system agent and the valence of the agent's feedback."
2024,PhishHunter: Detecting camouflaged IDN-based phishing attacks via Siamese neural network,Maoli Wang and Xiaodong Zang and Jianbo Cao and Bowen Zhang and Shengbao Li,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103668,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404823005783,,,,"Phishing is one of the significant threats to cybersecurity today, especially when attackers create Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) homographs to engage in phishing activities. IDN homograph takes advantage of some characters in different native languages in internationalized domain names that look similar to legitimate ones. Although researchers have proposed several enlightening detection methods, most of them focused on detecting typosquatting domain names. The ones focused on IDN homograph attack detection either need to enhance the generalization ability or improve detection performance caused by data imbalance. In this paper, we devised a Generative Adversarial Network with a Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) algorithm to solve the data imbalance problem. We transform domain names into images and calculate their similarity by Siamese neural networks. Our work can identify whether a domain name is IDN homograph or not effectively. We use the dataset generated based on Unicode tables, publicly available homograph tools, and the Internet traffic captured from the China Education Research Network backbone (CERNET) to evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy and reduces the false positive rate in detecting homograph domain names. In addition, it can also accurately identify typosquatting in phishing pages."
2024,"The realities of achieving a Smart, Sustainable, and Inclusive shopfloor in the age of Industry 5.0.",Amberlynn Bonello and Emmanuel Francalanza and Paul Refalo,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2024.02.059,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050924002369,,,,"The employment of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing has paved the way to interlinked machinery, shop floor flexibility and personalised production. However, despite the amplified level of productivity and efficiency, such advances may also take a toll on the operators’ skills and well-being. Over and above, worker diversification culminates in the novel ideology of Industry 5.0; where a triad is established between sustainability, human-centricity, and resilience within manufacturing. This broadens the horizon for worker diversification, especially for people with disabilities who may be estranged from the manufacturing shop floor due to an absence of accessibility, stigma, and other lingering challenges. In pursuit of comprehending these hurdles in the form of themes, a set of interviews were conducted with designers and engineers from a range of manufacturing companies, followed by a Reflexive Thematic Analysis Exercise. Three umbrella themes and eight sub-themes revealed an apparent level of friction between manufacturing engineers and the potential of recruiting operators with disabilities, a lack of design knowledge in creating inclusive workstations, and an absence of social sustainability with respect to disability employment in manufacturing. Accordingly, two major areas for future work by engineers, designers and academics are also proposed."
2024,Technology Adoption: Continuance Intention of E-Learning,Satrio Matin Utomo and  Indriana and Doni Purnama Alamsyah,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2024.10.223,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705092403031X,,,,"This study aims to examine a model that is able to increase the continuance intention of students to use the concept of e-learning on campus. There are several variables studied in testing the model including facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, and usefulness of students. Analysis of the model is carried out by surveying users, namely students, who have interacted with the concept of e-learning. In the study, quantitative questionnaires were distributed to 469 students in Bandung (Indonesia), with experience using e-learning as an online learning method. The research model was tested through the SEM (Structural Equation Model) approach with the SmartPLS tool, while the test was carried out twice with the PLS Algorithm and Bootstrapping process. Furthermore, the evaluation of the model through the Inner and Outer tests and research hypothesis testing. The test results stated that the self-efficacy of students has a positive relationship with the perceived usefulness of students, and indirectly self-efficacy is also able to increase the continuance intention of students on the concept of e-learning on campus. Perceived usefulness from students is able to mediate between self-efficacy and increase student continuance intention. Another finding from the research is that the facilitation conditions of e-learning owned by students are not able to change the perceived usefulness and continuance intention. The novelty of the research explains that there is a new model, namely the technology adoption model on the e-learning concept, which will run well if it is supported by the self-efficacy of the user and the mediation of perceived usefulness. This research is important to pay attention to, especially for universities that implement the concept of e-learning, which need to pay attention to the readiness of students related to self-efficacy and perceived usefulness."
