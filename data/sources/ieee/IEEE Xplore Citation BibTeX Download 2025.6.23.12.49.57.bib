  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the use of advanced computational algorithms and technologies to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines or computer systems. Human expression is incredibly important in determining a person’s current condition and mood. AI is utilized to analyze human facial expressions and extract emotions based on features such as cheeks, forehead, eyes, and smiles. In addition, “songs” refers to an expressive medium that has always been the best option for analyzing and comprehending human emotions. The proposed ’smart music player' is a programmed system that functions under the assumption that we can tell someone’s mood by the expression on his/her face. This model that recognizes facial micro-expressions with multicultural facial expression details, recommends music in accordance with corresponding mood. It is developed using a combination of song’s features and micro-expression recognition technology of convolutional neural network. To do this, group facial expressions into seven distinct emotional groups, including happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprise and disgust. The primary objective of this study paper is to present an overview of a useful music player and social companion that automatically creates a playlist that will brighten your day based on your emotional condition, along with recommendations for future studies in the field of recommendation systems.},

  abstract={In today's multicultural world, where the meeting of different cultures breeds suspicion and division, the school has the responsibility to provide adequate support so that every person develop an open and aware identity. The community is a space of identity developed through the idea and the perception of being part of a group of persons that believe in the same objectives and ideals. The development of a community of teachers within a project focused on the gamification of prosocial learning for increased youth inclusion and academic achievement, allows us to analyse in depth the social and the pedagogical aspects that lies underneath the structure of a community. The teachers are the core elements and they will be guided by the project partners through the different steps of the community building: the sharing of the values, then the practices and finally the actions, in a path that will grant the fruitful growth of such community.},

  abstract={Colleges and universities are the main battlefield for ideological construction in many countries and political parties. They are also at the forefront of the fusion and confrontation of multicultural and various online social trends. In the era of big data, a variety of ideological trends in the network society are surging, and non-Marxist ideological consciousness is growing. All of these have brought huge challenges to the ideological and political education of Chinese universities. The way of Chinese universities using ideological and political education to lead the ideological trend of the Internet society is of great importance in practice. Chinese universities should speed up the construction of a socialist ideological discourse system with Chinese characteristics. Besides, they should improve the quality of ideological and political education. What's more, they must innovate ideological education methods. At the same time, Chinese ideological and political educators should lead the college student group to resist all kinds of erroneous trends in the Internet society and support the ideological and political education work of college students in China. This series of measures is of great significance for promoting the theme.},

  abstract={Engineering education focuses on finding solutions to societal challenges. The phenomenon of globalization continues to relax the societal boundaries. Communication technologies have shrunk the distances through increased connectivity. Flow of information around the globe is almost instant. The world has essentially become a global village. The concept of society and societal challenges continue to evolve. Engineers frequently find themselves working in multinational projects and multinational teams. Understanding and respecting various cultures must of an integral part of training engineers to be effective in such environments. It is, therefore, essential to produce engineers with global competencies which include respect for diversity, difference of opinions, ethics, and multicultural social skills. When put in practice, these aspects bring tranquility, lead to social justice, and eventually to a peaceful world. This paper discusses a process to produce globally competent engineers with skills to promote peace. The paper includes curricular changes necessary to impart global competencies.},

  abstract={In this Work in Progress paper, we discuss why including professional competencies into computing education curriculum is important. We are particularly interested in competencies that students could and, we believe, should acquire during collaborative learning experiences in project-based IT courses. In the times of globalization and technological advancement, there is a need for competencies like collaborating, communicating, working in interdisciplinary and multicultural teams, while computing education tends to focus on content knowledge and technical skills. Which is contrary to the emphasis companies put on soft skills in a hiring situation. This discussion and reflection paper discuss how employability, and identity frameworks can be used to analyse professional competencies in a project course environment in Norway? This paper focuses on how professional competencies should be implemented in the curriculum of computing degree programs and courses in the Norwegian university system. We use Curtin's graduate attributes" framework used by an Australian university as an example of learning outcomes that emphasize professional competencies. In this conceptual paper we discuss how putting more emphasis on graduate attributes, employability and identity can help to legitimize diverse ways of participation in the computing discipline and at the same time broaden the identity of the computing discipline.},

  abstract={The IT industry provides supportive pathways such as returnship programs, coding boot camps, and buddy systems for women re-entering their job after a career break. Academia, however, offers limited opportunities to motivate women to return. We propose a diverse multicultural research project investigating the challenges faced by women with software engineering (SE) backgrounds re-entering academia or related research roles after a career break. Career disruptions due to pregnancy, immigration status, or lack of flexible work options can significantly impact women's career progress, creating barriers for returning as lecturers, professors, or senior researchers. Although many companies promote gender diversity policies, such measures are less prominent and often under-recognized within academic institutions. Our goal is to explore the specific challenges women encounter when re-entering academic roles compared to industry roles; to understand the institutional perspective, including a comparative analysis of existing policies and opportunities in different countries for women to return to the field; and finally, to provide recommendations that support transparent hiring practices. The research project will be carried out in multiple universities and in multiple countries to capture the diverse challenges and policies that vary by location.},

  abstract={Education is a continuous process that encompasses personal, social, and sociocultural aspects, based on a holistic view of human beings and their rights. It can be delivered in both formal and non-formal institutions, with the goal of instilling humanistic values. In the 21st century, education is closely linked to research, promoting community participation and addressing specific problems through educational projects. This approach includes science, technology, and society (STS), understood as integral elements for value-based education and civic engagement. Currently, education is undergoing a significant transformation, adapting to technological and scientific challenges to improve educational quality. It is essential that educational systems promote skills such as critical thinking and the ability to adapt to a changing economy. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are crucial, enabling meaningful and autonomous learning. Furthermore, family involvement is crucial in the educational process, as parental support improves students' performance and school adaptation. 21st-century educators must be dynamic and flexible, fostering collaborative and empathetic learning in a multicultural environment. The current educational reality, especially in Latin America, presents challenges such as unequal access and the need to train students with relevant skills for social integration. The challenges include the implementation of competencies and the promotion of learning that responds to the demands of the knowledge society. In summary, modern education requires constant innovation, integrating technology and new methodologies to prepare students for a constantly changing future. Teachers and students must adapt to these changes, being proactive in their training and in the application of didactic strategies that foster meaningful and relevant learning.},

Peru is a multicultural country that officially has 48 native languages. From them to 17 have problems of extinction, although 4 of these languages are almost extinct, one of them is Taushiro, which has only one survivor over 70 years, who participated with his voice and knowledge of their culture in the development of the mobile application. Functional and non-functional requirements have been identified based on the conditions of urban and rural spaces for the use of the application. The offline mobile application was generated, for the basic learning of Taushiro through the sounds of the only speaker. Its interactive contents are oriented to children from cities and rural communities and are classified through vowels, numbers, basic phrases, colors, fauna and flora, etc. The validation was carried out in an educational institution in the city of Iquitos, 24 children between 6 and 7 years old participated. The results have been satisfactory with respect to the interest and learning of the children towards the Taushiro language, however, it is necessary that this initiative be complemented with other instruments (with more advanced contents) and other activities and instruments.},

By providing a web-based management system, this site can easily provide these solutions to the owners and the customers. As well different companies begin their Cable operator’s business and become an important part of economics, also increasing competition through this field. For this cause of online dependence, this website is built for cable operators to increase their size. In our region, cable operator operation is becoming a wide enterprise. Even in deep rural areas, there is already a link to the cable operator through the televisions that have multicultural activities. Mainly this website is created along with a web portal by our project properly. The goal is to ensure a proper management system created for the owner of this field and also enable them to satisfy their customers as well. This ‘Cable Operator Management System’ will create a new era in the field of cable operation.},

  abstract={Since 1993 nine universities in the University of Texas System and several affiliated community colleges have worked collaboratively to promote STEM undergraduate research through the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. In 2012 the Alliance was recognized as a model Senior Alliance by the National Science Foundation and to expand on its work an international research component was added: the Summer Research Academy Abroad (SRA-A). Our first cohort of eight students travelled abroad during the summer of 2014. The students participated in an intensive undergraduate research experience for eight weeks and thus became part of the global STEM community. Prior to their departure these students enrolled in a spring 2014 online seminar to prepare them for both the scientific and cultural components of the SRA-A experience. They learned to operate with confidence in new, unfamiliar environments and gained a multicultural perspective. They also acquired early membership and credibility in the global science arena and began to understand the competitiveness that drives the international research community. This paper discusses program details, participant profiles, and assessment after the program's first year of operation.},

  abstract={This article analyzes the Disney movie Mulan as a typical case of cross-cultural communication. The sentiment analysis of the movie Mulan’s review on the Rotten Tomatoes website, an influential movie-review aggregation site, has been conducted through Python coding technology. The analysis results show that nearly 86.5% of movie reviews are positive. It is found Mulan has been highly accepted by Western audiences and maintained a positive image in Western countries. One of the reasons is that the film has a large amount of traditional Chinese cultural elements, satisfying the world’s curiosity and expectations of Eastern civilization; another reason is that the flint integrates the mainstream Western values such as free and independent feminist ideas and personal heroism, catering to the tastes of movie audiences. This research offers a new perspective that focuses on the audiences’ response and explores the common issues of cross-cultural communication in the new era of multicultural collision.},

  abstract={Many web resources require an accurate representation of family relationships. However, available ontologies describing this kind of relationships provide only simple and rudimentary representations. In addition, the transition from one culture/language to another cannot be solved with simple translation solutions, specifically when concepts do not intersect in different cultures. In this paper, we propose a new ontology, called PersonLink, that defines rigorously and precisely different family relationships, and takes into account the differences that may exist between cultures and new relationships emerging in our societies nowadays. It provides a solution based on multicultural meta-ontology of concepts and associated mechanisms. Moreover, rules are provided to infer new links and/or check inconsistencies in the inputs. The PersonLink ontology has been applied, first, in the context of the CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis (for modeling, storing, and reasoning on “family relationships” links), and then, in the context of the two large scale real-world datasets, Freebase and DBpedia.},

  abstract={The United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda and other movements toward setting global goals such as the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal/U.S. Green New Deal are laying the groundwork for a transformation beyond purely market-based economics toward sustainability and inclusiveness [1], in which technological innovation and, in particular, artificial intelligence (AI) can play a central role. The European Union (EU) is committed to the 2030 Agenda and the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which the UN itself has recognized cannot be achieved without a people-focused, science-based, digital revolution [2]. This commitment to the 2030 Agenda should entail promoting an inclusive and sustainable AI strategy, rather than a strategy with a narrow focus on competitiveness [3], [4]. In order for AI to contribute to achieving the SDGs, a systemic approach to the development of AI solutions is required [5]-[9]. Conversely, the SDGs provide an ideal framework to test the desirability of AI solutions [10]. Europe's multicultural character and its framework of international collaboration give it a head start toward becoming a global reference in the promotion of an inclusive and sustainable AI. Sharing the experiences and practices of such a European AI could make a significant contribution to achieving the SDGs.},

  abstract={Code-mixing is a phenomenon where at least two languages are combined in a hybrid manner in the context of a single conversation. The use of mixed language is widespread in multilingual and multicultural countries and poses significant challenges for the development of automated language processing tools. In Taiwan’s electronic health record (EHR) systems, unstructured EHR texts are usually represented in a mixture of English and Chinese which increases the difficulty for de-identification and synthetization of protected health information (PHI). We explored this problem by applying several state-of-the-art pre-trained mono- and multilingual language models and propose to exploit the principle-based approach (PBA) for the tasks of PHI recognition and resynthesis on a code-mixed EHR corpus annotated with 6 main categories and 25 subcategories of PHIs. A hierarchical principle slot schema is defined in the PBA to encode knowledge of code-mixed PHIs and utilize slots to learn from the training set to assemble principles for recognizing PHI mentions and synthesizing surrogates simultaneously. In addition, a semantic disambiguation process is implemented to disambiguate ambiguous PHI categories in the de-identification process and to dynamically extend the knowledge encoded in PBA during the knowledge augmentation process. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the best micro- and macro-F-scores in comparison to the other mono- and multilingual language models fine-tuned on our code-mixed corpus.},

  abstract={Introduction: Professional communication instructors in transnational contexts face unique challenges when helping students transition into the workplace. These challenges include preparing students for multilingual workplaces and educational settings, as well as multicultural communication in English at transnational workplaces. About the case: The authors, working at an international branch campus (IBC) in the Middle East, wanted to revise their assignments in a technical writing course for engineers in order to better prepare students for the realities of professional communication in the region. Situating the case: Engineering students matriculate into an increasingly diverse workplace, but instructors may not adequately understand the needs of employers in transnational corporations. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with students and alumni of the IBC, and transcripts were coded for common themes. Results/discussion: Students and alumni had different perceptions of workplace communication genres, expectations for detailed writing, and the ability to adapt rhetorical strategies for different contexts. Alumni experienced a gap between their professors' and their workplaces' expectations for business genres and level of detail. They also reported that one of their significant challenges was adopting a flexible mindset toward written and spoken communication practices. Conclusions: Professional communication instructors should emphasize the strengths of multilingual writers, particularly their sense of language difference and rhetorical attunement, to better prepare them for the transnational workplace, in both the US and abroad. The authors describe changes in their pedagogy to help students adopt a more flexible and industry-oriented mindset toward technical communication.},

  abstract={With the rapidly growing penetration of social media networks in linguistically diverse and multicultural developing nations like Ethiopia, the conversations of online users have increasingly become more casual and multilingual. The emergency of hate speech text system. To this end, various automated hate speech detection and classification systems have been developed for resource-rich languages such as English and French even though online users are using many other languages on different social media platforms. Afan Oromo is one natural language used by social media users to express feelings, emotions and share messages. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of an intelligent system that can automatically detect and classify hate speech, especially for resource-scarce indigenous Ethiopian languages like Afan Oromo. This work is about the identification of hate speech text from comments and posts generated in resource scary poor language Afan Oromo. We prepared first hate speech text detection dataset of Afan Oromo that containing comments and posts from social media. Then, n-gram and TF-IDF feature selection approaches were employed to select features. After the important feature selected Natural language processing tasks applied on the dataset. We applied six machine learning classifiers from default and tuned parameters to detect hate speech text posts and comments. The experiment show that Support Vector Machine outperform 92&#x0025; values of F-measure than classifiers Afan Oromo hate speech text detection dataset. This Afan Oromo hate speech text dataset publicly available on https://www.naolinfo.info/for further research.},

  abstract={Modern society is diverse, multicultural, and multifaceted. Because of these characteristics, we are currently observing an increase in the debates about equity, diversity, and inclusion in different areas, especially because several groups of individuals are underrepresented in many environments. In computer science and software engineering, it seems counterintuitive that these areas, which are responsible for creating technological solutions and systems for billions of users around the world, do not reflect the diversity of the society to which it serves. In trying to solve this diversity crisis in the software industry, researchers started to investigate strategies that can be applied to increase diversity and improve inclusion in academia and the software industry. However, the lack of diversity in computer science and related courses, including software engineering, is still a problem, in particular when some specific groups are considered. LGBTQIA+ students, for instance, face several challenges to fit into technology courses, even though most students in universities right now belong to Generation Z, which is described as open-minded to aspects of gender and sexuality. In this study, we aimed to discuss the state-of-art of publications about the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ students in computer science education. Using a mapping study, we identified eight studies published in the past six years that focused on this public. We present strategies developed to adapt curricula and lectures to be more inclusive to LGBTQIA+ students and discuss challenges and opportunities for future research.},

  abstract={The European Project Semester (EPS) is a one-semester capstone project/internship programme offered to engineering, product design and business undergraduates by 18 European engineering schools. EPS aims to prepare future engineers to think and act globally, by adopting project-based learning and teamwork methodologies, fostering the development of complementary skills and addressing sustainability and multiculturalism. Since 2011, the EPS@ISEP programme offers a set of multidisciplinary projects to multicultural teams of students, so that each team element can bring to the project its previous knowledge and background experience. In the spring of 2013, a team choose to develop a pet tracker to provide pet owners with information regarding the whereabouts of their pets and, above all, to reduce the number of pets lost. After analysing related products, the team decided to add extra features for product differentiation. Combining a triple-axis accelerometer, a low cost GPS receiver and the GSM/GPRS communication technology, the team designed a system providing pet location, tracking, map display and activity monitoring services. This paper describes the development process of the Pet Tracker system, comprising a wearable device for pets and a website for pet owners.},

  abstract={Universities around the world are increasingly under pressure to `internationalise' and to support and embrace multicultural student bodies and learning environments. At the same time, `internationalisation' is often associated with issues that complicate and pressurise the experiences of `international students' as they attempt to identify and acculturate in their new settings, both socially and educationally, such as blockages in cultural understanding, language barriers and complexities of cross-cultural collaboration. This paper sets out a novel approach to solving these issues for a particular set of students (the large proportion of Chinese studying in Ireland, and specifically in Dublin) by creating original cross-cultural collaborative games (coded by Python) and using gamification based on a new bespoke technology system. This design aims to bridge the gaps in understanding between cultures and to provide an enhanced experience which may even be seen to exceed the levels of engagement of students collaborating in `live' environments. The gamification provides a fun and safe way for Chinese and Irish students to share their culture and language, through unique cross-cultural collaborative games set in a customised bilingually-designed virtual world on a new 3D virtual cloud platform. SMARTlab is developing this unique platform with Hao2 and 3DICC's Terf (an immersive 3D unified collaboration platform integrating game dynamics and adjustable features) and OpenSIM. Our novel collaborative platform further integrates the unique `Virtual World in A Backpack' with a bespoke personalised learning platform in development (Sensei). We show that virtual exposure to Ireland and `Irishness' and the chance to collaborate over time with Irish students can lessen the impact of cultural change and reduce the symptoms of isolation, leading to a more empower and enjoyable learning experience.},

  abstract={Internationalization is the developing trend of engineering education in the contemporary world. An increasing number of Chinese universities provide international engineering education programs for undergraduates majoring in engineering in the form of Lecture-Based Learning models that sometimes separate theory from practice. In this paper, we define the most important competencies of engineers with international competitiveness as being Multicultural, Multidisciplinary, Innovative, Integrative, and skilled in Leadership and develop the International Engineering Practice Program (IEPP) based on Project-Based Learning (PBL) to foster these five competencies. In IEPP, students cooperate in the multidisciplinary research in defining problems, designing, manufacturing, and showcasing the projects. A team composed of one project supervisor, project instructors and assistants are built to guide the students for the practical work and theoretical lectures are offered to them for basic knowledge. Throughout the program, English is used as the working language to develop the student's international outlook. This education model has been evaluated as successful: some students' projects won the top prize in national technological competitions and over 90% of the students consider it effective in both enriching their knowledge base and enhancing their abilities despite slightly more workload.},

  abstract={In universities, it is well known that implement projects with Industry is beneficial for students as they develop different outcomes that will help them in their professional activities. If to this relationship between Industry-University, students from different universities of the world are added to collaborate in international engineering projects, the benefits will be greater: Students will learn ways of working from other countries, so that will help to create societies of engineers who will interact with harmony between countries and cultures. Links between students from different countries will be created to solve common engineering projects. This article is about the experiences of Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus State of Mexico, as a member of an academic program with Automotive Industry called PACE (Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering Education). In this program, international projects were developed, making teamwork with students from different universities of the world. Students worked in multidisciplinary and multicultural teams with different time zones and languages. Videoconferencing tools were used for long-distance communication. Each year a forum was organized, where teams met to deliver progress and their finished project. Projects were related to different areas of Automotive Engineering such as design, manufacturing and production of components.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In this work-in-progress research paper, we report an exploratory study on the role of onboarding programs in preparing early-career engineers for engineering practice. For many years, undergraduate engineering programs have focused primarily on the classroom experience. To provide more authentic pre-professional preparation, however, undergraduate programs have increasingly encouraged outof-class experiences such as senior design capstone projects, project-based learning, and service learning. While engineering students now graduate with stronger preparation for professional practice, employers still invest significant resources in onboarding programs for early-career engineers. These onboarding programs may include a combination of classroom experiences, technical department rotations, and mentorship. Employers like the Indiana State Department of Transportation, Caterpillar Inc., and General Electric describe their onboarding programs as including technical elements like design, professional skill development such as leadership, and in some cases, mentorship.Although many research studies suggest that project-based learning and service learning programs enhance student preparedness for engineering practice, little is known about how onboarding programs develop the knowledge and skills of early-career engineers, and how these programs build upon the knowledge that they acquired as undergraduates. Preliminary findings suggest that the transitional onboarding programs in engineering practice strengthen competencies such as working on multicultural teams, networking skills, and develop project management skills.},

  abstract={In higher education, the use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represents a Triad of Visual Digital Innovation (TVDI), which is transforming teaching and learning processes, particularly in international collaborative projects. During the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022), teaching experiences with different technologies were developed, to captivate students who continued their studies virtually. At the end of the confinement, the use of the triad increased exponentially. However, the lack of specific methodologies that effectively integrate these technologies in a multicultural and sustainable context remains a challenge. The cases presented in this work demonstrate the potential of TVDI to improve teaching-learning experiences at a professional level and related to creative disciplines, which can promote greater motivation, immersion and even international collaboration. The findings suggest that the educational innovations and methodologies developed can be adapted and replicated in other educational contexts and projects that seek to integrate TDVI to address local and global challenges.},

  abstract={This work investigates how participation in the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand Challenge Scholars Program (GCSP) influences first year engineering students' development of a systems perspective. Students in the NAE GCSP participate in curricular and extracurricular activities to gain research/project experience, an interdisciplinary perspective, an entrepreneurial mindset, multicultural awareness, and social consciousness. At Arizona State University, most GCSP students begin program participation in their first year, primarily through a GCSP specific course designed to help them to develop an interdisciplinary perspective. Each year, approximately 20-25 percent of the incoming GCSP freshmen get involved in the program before classes start, during a weeklong summer program. To evaluate how these GCSP activities influence students' development of systems perspective, qualitative research methods were used to analyze students' end of semester course reflections. Results of a thematic analysis of the data indicate that first year students participating in these activities experience a change in how they think about engineering, recognizing the complexity of problems facing society and the need to consider societal factors (e.g. policy, culture) when developing engineering solutions.},

  abstract={Natural language Processing (NLP) is the fledgling field of computer comprehension and analysis of human language. One of the world’s most multilingual and multicultural countries is India. Given that Indians live in different regions and speak different regional languages, the country has the second-highest number of languages in the world. Whereas in India English is offered as the second language. But India uses little English, which creates a communication barrier. It is nearly difficult for the people to fill this language gap by converting one language into another, but it can be accomplished through Machine Translation (MT). The primary goal of this paper is to translate Indian languages using neural networks translating Hindi into English and vice versa, with the help of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and sequence to sequence model with an encoder-decoder attention mechanism is put forth.},

  abstract={Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) connects students and professors from different countries, universities, cultures, and educational models to engage in projects and coursework, working together for a common goal. By implementing this collaboration in courses that are part of the engineering program study plan, both students and faculty develop different disciplinary and transversal competencies while learning the knowledge and skills required for their specific engineering programs. In the context of engineering education, program accreditations are quite relevant to ensure the standards and quality to develop graduates that are well prepared to enter the global workforce and contribute to build a better world. This study analyzes the student outcomes of different engineering accreditation organizations to identify common student outcomes and explore the impact of COIL experiences to contribute to the development of these student outcomes. Some COIL experiences in literature report that students build communication skills, work in multicultural environments creating consciousness about different social, economic and political contexts, develop critical thinking and problem-solving competencies while proposing solutions to complex problems, among others. This study aims to investigate how COIL courses align to the development of engineering student outcomes and document COIL as a tool for this purpose, emphasizing best practices and recommendations for universities that intend to engage in this pedagogical approach.},

  abstract={As engineering graduates increasingly assume leadership roles in technology-driven organizations, their education must evolve beyond technical excellence to encompass business acumen, organizational leadership, and intercultural competence. This mixed-methods study examines an innovative pedagogical approach integrating socio-technical awareness and stakeholder management into engineering education through problem-based learning. Through a semester-long intervention with 43 participants, we investigated how restructured learning environments prepare engineering students for leadership roles in diverse, global contexts. Quantitative analysis revealed significant improvements in students' ability to identify business implications and stakeholder concerns, with notable gains in intercultural awareness among majority students. Qualitative analysis of student journals and interviews from 38 participants revealed three themes essential for future technical leaders: evolving professional identity, comfort with organizational ambiguity, and cross-cultural stakeholder engagement. Teams with diverse composition demonstrated higher performance in solution viability and business impact assessment, while structured cross-cultural exchanges improved cultural humility across all participants. Students from diverse backgrounds showed superior initial stakeholder awareness compared to their peers, their perspectives enhancing majority students' understanding of global markets and inclusive decision-making. The integration of modern business tools, including AI-aided stakeholder mapping, provided insights into technology management in multicultural contexts. Through careful scaffolding of learning experiences and intentional reflection activities, students developed both technical competence and leadership capabilities simultaneously. The study also revealed important considerations for scaling these approaches, particularly regarding faculty development and institutional support structures. Our findings demonstrate that embedding business principles and intercultural experiences in engineering education through structured reflection better prepares students for executive roles in global organizations. These results contribute to ongoing discussions about engineering education reform while emphasizing the critical need for institutional support in developing the next generation of engineering leaders who can effectively navigate the intersections of technology, business, and diverse societal needs.},

  abstract={In contemporary design education, the influx of diverse design accomplishments and methodologies, especially those involving interdisciplinary and cross-regional collaboration, poses a significant challenge. Understanding and expressing user and environmental needs within technology, aesthetics, and culture is central to addressing these issues. Since 2016, we have addressed this challenge through a joint design workshop course for 3rd and 4th-year students, aiming to foster cross-cultural understanding and communication skills, thus developing international expertise in design. This course employs a project-based learning (PBL) approach and is a staple in our department's curriculum. It involves mixed groups from our university and international partners working on specific design problems and presenting their solutions. The course, conducted primarily in English, emphasizes non-native linguistic and non-verbal communication through visual expressions like sketches and drawings. One objective is to provide students with the skills necessary for effective cross-cultural communication. Typically, this intensive summer course alternates annually between Japan and partner countries. However, the COVID-19 pandemic 2020 necessitated a shift to an online format to maintain the course's objectives despite travel restrictions. This paper highlights the adaptations made from FY2020 to FY2021 to continue the program online. Our international collaborations led to developing a PBL-based active learning method, crucial for enhancing cross-cultural understanding and communication in design education. Utilizing the technology and methods refined during the pandemic, we successfully conducted a hybrid online/on-site workshop connecting Japan and Taiwan. Online tools facilitated remote group work, discussions, and feedback, accommodating a diverse, multicultural cohort through synchronous and asynchronous communication.},

  abstract={The popularity of online shopping has boosted the volume of customer reviews, which is crucial for business growth and decision-making as they influence consumers' purchasing decisions. Indians frequently engage in code-mixing, a social media practice where multilingual users publish comments that give information about consumer preferences, cultural relevance, and product or service improvement. Businesses with an Indian market emphasis should consider this factor to improve the consumer experience. Indian languages often face resource constraints, making it difficult to create precise language models and carry out operations like sentiment analysis, spam filtering, offensive text recognition, etc. Through this work, we draw the researcher's attention to the relevance of processing code-mixed customer reviews for e-commerce sites in linguistically diverse regions like India and how it helps to serve customers better, improve goods and services, and stay competitive in a globalised and multicultural market. This work aims to expand Malayalam-English (Manglish) code-mixed literature in the commercial domain by constructing a sentiment corpus featuring customer reviews in Manglish related to commercial products annotated by voluntary annotators. The performance of different machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for the sentiment identification task is then assessed using the new corpus, and a comprehensive analysis of the results is also presented.},

All these elements and approaches to a diverse and multicultural territory make up the systemic and binding methodological framework between qualitative elements (Intangible Cultural Heritage) and quantitative elements (environmental and climatic conditions), all of which make up AraucanAI elements. Thus, the strategic design of the methodology integrates several variables, resulting in a proposal for intelligent rural planning. The elements studied from the patterns of the Mapuche native people collaborate in decision making with respect to both practical and conceptual issues regarding the valuation of the territory and its components, patterns, limits and boundaries. This holistic proposal underlies the intention of developing a territorial regenerative design tool. This new tool represents a basis for the future recovery of a rural territory highly degraded by industrial forestry and home to more than 2,000 native Mapuche communities.},

Intrigued by this phenomenon, we analyzed the writing of final year technical knowledge as well as competent soft skills. This is awareness increasingly being demanded by professional accreditation bodies. In response, institutions of higher education nowadays have courses or programs that teach students the soft skills part of these requirements, with the hope that by graduation, students can successfully demonstrate that they have met the accreditation standards. Anecdotal evidence from our academic staff, however, have shown that many graduating students have poor writing skills. This is also true for students engineering students, by examining their honors year capstone project reports. By examining the writing competence of these graduating students, the writing mistakes encountered in the reports were collected, analyzed and we propose to develop an online repository, together with the suggested corrections, so that students have online access to additional English writing support. Through this investigation, so-far, we have also uncovered that simple writing mistakes exist in the final version of an academic supervisor approved report.

  abstract={In our multicultural world, affect-aware AI systems that support humans need the ability to perceive affect across variations in emotion expression patterns across cultures. These systems must perform well in cultural contexts without annotated affect datasets available for training models. A standard assumption in affective computing is that affect recognition models trained and used within the same culture (intracultural) will perform better than models trained on one culture and used on different cultures (intercultural). We test this assumption and present the first systematic study of intercultural affect recognition models using videos of real-world dyadic interactions from six cultures. We develop an attention-based feature selection approach under temporal causal discovery to identify behavioral cues that can be leveraged in intercultural affect recognition models. Across all six cultures, our findings demonstrate that intercultural affect recognition models were as effective or more effective than intracultural models. We identify and contribute useful behavioral features for intercultural affect recognition; facial features from the visual modality were more useful than the audio modality in this study's context. Our paper presents a proof-of-concept and motivation for the future development of intercultural affect recognition systems, especially those deployed in low-resource situations without annotated data.},

  abstract={Today it is more crucial than ever to remove language barriers in the linked world of today. This study compares and contrasts on-demand live translation services with an emphasis on effectiveness and accuracy. It presents a workable approach to smooth multilingual communication, with a focus on Indian languages. A state-of-the-art on-call speech translation system built on a sentence-level Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model is revealed in this work. The NMT approach translates individual sentences, as opposed to previous algorithms that work with full documents, guaranteeing accuracy and context awareness. NMT, BERT, and XL Net are also compared, emphasizing their unique qualities and areas of use. To facilitate easy communication in chosen languages, this model supports Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Urdu, Bengali, and English. This helps address the linguistic variety of India. Its versatility and efficacy are a result of intensive training on a wide range of language pairings, highlighting the contribution of technology to intercultural communication. The study emphasizes how the NMT-based on-call voice translation system improves commu-nication accessibility in our multicultural, globalized society by bridging linguistic gaps, particularly in Indian languages. In addition, a unique application of multithreading has been employed to lower latency by concurrently executing the transcription and translation operations. Research shows that when multithreading is used, the time required for a translation decreases to 93.82 seconds from an initial 137 seconds. This helps to some extent with the latency issue},

  abstract={The working midst has become challenging due to the multicultural environment and the need of skills such as cultural understanding, are very important in the formation of an engineer. It has been like this for many years however, now more than ever. So, for engineering schools, internationalization has become, on top of others, another demand for the accomplishment of a good program. It became necessary to provide international academic experience for the students. For this reason, internationalization is now a strategy to raise the quality of courses and as another result of these efforts, to raise the engineering students' retention rate along the program. The goal of this paper is to present and discuss the internationalization process of a University's engineering school, with the objective of making the program more attractive and promoting the double diploma in order to higher the quality of the programs.},

The team, rather than the individual, is the basic building block of technology and product development. The use of 'virtual' team is becoming more widespread in a number of disciplines, including software and engineering, as is the topic of leading and managing teams in a cross&#x2010;border, multicultural environment. The leadership of technology and product development projects is a surprisingly multifacetted but potentially very satisfying and rewarding role. Most importantly, the leader is the holder and champion of the high&#x2010;level vision for the new development; he or she is the 'master architect'. The primary means of personal development is through the work itself, not through an endless succession of training courses. The speed of personal development can be accelerated by providing the right opportunities to acquire the skills, supported by guidance and mentoring.},

  abstract={The emergence of the personal computer and internet in the last quarter of the 20th century has triggered the development of corpus linguistic studies that enable researchers to investigate big data in synchronic and diachronic settings. Scholars have developed Corpus tools to provide linguistic analysis features such as word lists, keywords, collocations, and concordances. In 2003, a lexicographer named Adam Kilgariff developed Sketch Engine, which provides more than 700 text corpora in monolingual and multilingual forms and enables users to create their corpus by crawling the data online or uploading the compiled corpus themselves. In the Indonesian context, Sketch Engine has yet to be used widely, even though this tool provides a promising opportunity in language research. This paper discusses 1) the linguistic features available in Sketch Engine, 2) recent language research articles utilizing Sketch Engine, and 3) possible opportunities and barriers for Indonesia’s research. A conceptual and systematic review of corpus linguistics and Sketch Engine is provided to reach the objectives. The analysis found that Indonesian researchers have not contributed yet to the Indonesian corpus development in Sketch Engine. Possible barriers are as follows: 1) the subscription charge, 2) the unfamiliarity of the tool in corpus linguistic publication in Indonesia, and 3) the lack of understanding and application of corpus linguistics in Indonesian academia. Considering Indonesia as a multicultural country, vast opportunities in micro- and macro-linguistic studies will be beneficial to improve the research quality in the Indonesian context.},

  abstract={The development of competencies is vital in academic training, especially in engineering, where technical, collaborative, and multidisciplinary skills are essential. However, assessing these competencies in team projects poses challenges, primarily in distinguishing individual contributions, leading to potentially subjective evaluations. Differences in students' skill levels further complicate this process. Despite these difficulties, collaborative work is crucial for building the professional and multicultural skills needed in today's global job market. This research introduces an innovative evaluation strategy to better assess individual contributions within teams. The methodology includes a two-phase individual questionnaire. In the first phase, students outline a solution to a problem in defined steps to ensure comprehensive involvement and understanding. They then correct an intentionally misformulated question, demonstrating their ability to identify and justify corrections. The second phase involves exercises to assess students' grasp of key theoretical concepts applied during their projects. Results showed a more balanced grade distribution and diverse competency development compared to previous semesters. This indicated that not all students develop competencies uniformly, emphasizing the need for tailored teaching and assessment. This study also opens paths for future research on promoting women's participation in STEM, with a focus on equitable development strategies in team settings. (Abstract)},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This article examines the influence of phonological awareness on vocabulary acquisition among dyslexic children in a multilingual Moroccan context. The study compares the performance of 20 children, both dyslexic and non-dyslexic, aged 6 to 16 years, assessed using tests for phoneme segmentation, deletion, and blending to measure phonological awareness, as well as receptive and expressive vocabulary tests. The results reveal that dyslexic children score significantly lower in phonological awareness, confirming the presence of phonological deficits within this group. However, correlation and regression analyses indicate weak and non-significant relationships between phonological awareness and vocabulary, contrary to existing literature. This divergence may be attributed to the small sample size, age dispersion, the use of non-adaptive standardized tests, and the complexity of the Moroccan linguistic context. To address these limitations, the development of a supervised classification model using a neural network is proposed. This model, based on local data, could refine diagnostics and identify diverse phonological and lexical profiles, thereby facilitating the development of tailored educational interventions. This study highlights the need for contextualized assessment tools and innovative approaches, integrating artificial intelligence, to better understand and support vocabulary acquisition in dyslexic children within multicultural environments.},

To explore the feasible method of Chinese movie’s external diffusion, we take 36 countries along the “Belt and Road” from 2017.12 to 2020.12 as the research object and use the Latent Dirichlet allocation topic model(LDA) to summarize six categories of topics. According to the box office distribution of each topic, all countries are divided into six categories, and we discuss the topic preferences of each country separately. To promote movie diffusion, for regions with significant cultural differences, the movie should be carried out according to their preferred topics; for regions with better development of the movie market but less cooperation, we should output high-quality local movies to carry out cooperation shooting at the same time; for regions with deep cultural exchanges and a weak economy, we should output movies with diverse culture and preaching national spirit. In addition, it is necessary to consider multiple factors such as the political and religious background to avoid breaking group taboos and formulate export plans according to local conditions to achieve multi-ethnic and multicultural integration further.},

  abstract={In an era of rapid globalization and increasing workforce mobility, assessing global competency has become a crucial factor for individuals and organizations aiming to thrive in diverse cultural and professional environments. The ability to effectively engage in cross-cultural interactions, demonstrate adaptability in dynamic workplaces, and possess the necessary problem-solving and communication skills is now more important than ever. As businesses expand internationally and educational institutions emphasize global awareness, competency assessment plays a pivotal role in determining the readiness of individuals to function in multicultural settings. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes a Global Competency Analysis System relies on Deep Learning (DL), utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for high-accuracy predictions. The proposed model leverages sequential data processing capabilities of LSTM to analyze multimodal inputs and provide robust competency classification and prediction outcomes. The system is designed to assess global competency through various indicators, including linguistic proficiency, cultural adaptability, problem-solving skills, emotional intelligence, and professional expertise. It processes multimodal data, incorporating text-based responses, behavioral metrics, and historical performance data to generate competency scores. The LSTM-based model is trained on a carefully curated dataset, ensuring diversity and representation to eliminate biases and improve generalizability. Feature extraction techniques are employed to optimize relevant competency indicators, while advanced hyperparameter tuning is implemented to elevate the approach’s efficiency and predictive performance. Extensive experimentation and validation of the proposed framework were conducted using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. The approach attained an exceptional accuracy of 99.4%, depicting its effectiveness in competency evaluation. The impressive precision and recall scores signify the system’s capability to minimize both false positives and false negatives, ensuring reliable assessment results.},

  abstract={A visually challenged person may find it challenging to distinguish between various denominations of currency. For those who are blind, this process is still challenging even though most of the Indian currency is written in unique characters. Portable solutions for isolation have emerged because of a shortage of available tools. This study details the creation and evaluation of a new assistive technology that uses an easy-to-use currency detection system to improve the financial independence of people with visual impairments. The apparatus employs sophisticated image processing techniques and deep learning algorithms to precisely recognize different banknote denominations. A compact, user-friendly interface that provides audio feedback to convey the denomination to the user ensures ease of use and privacy. A portable computer device connected to a high-resolution camera forms the basis of the system architecture. On this device, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is trained using many datasets of cash photos in various orientations and light conditions. A high recognition accuracy rate is attained by the model, which is essential for real-world uses. Voice commands and tactile buttons work together to make it easy for users to engage with the gadget. Many daily living tasks are made more difficult by the prevalence of visual impairment, particularly those that require the recognition of currency, leaving the affected person dependent on others to complete financial transactions. Its ability to quickly and accurately identify different currencies and output format in audio feedback has proven to be highly beneficial for those with visual impairments who travel or live in multicultural environments. Moreover, positive feedback from user experience evaluations indicates that the system's practical impact extends beyond its technical achievements, with considerable improvements in confidence during financial transactions and ease of use. To ease that dependency, a unique Currency Detector System (CDS) made especially for visually impaired individuals has been created.},

  abstract={This research-to-practice full paper describes our integration of global learning perspectives through a research-based group project in a First-Year Seminar course for new technology major students at our urban Midwestern university, IUPUI (Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis). Since 2003, the ACE (American Council on Education) has emphasized global competencies, which are defined as "the attitudes, skills, and knowledge to live and work in a multicultural and interconnected world". Despite the increasing recognition of the importance of developing these global competencies, opportunities for young people to do so suffer from issues of accessibility. Educational institutions are challenged with providing opportunities to prepare students for global citizenship in the twenty-first century and are working to expand global competency education. Our undergraduate institution is no exception.In accordance with this mission, we incorporated global learning perspectives through a group project in our First-Year-Seminar course to increase students’ interest in global learning experiences (such as studying abroad) and provide resources for students to develop global competencies. This is important both for personal development in the quest for a more equitable world and employability; employers repeatedly convey that awareness of global issues is a highly desirable characteristic in potential hires.In our implementation, students selected a global issue, chosen from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals database, which had unique significance to them and their communities. This approach allowed space for students to take ownership and agency over the content of their learning experiences while ensuring they engaged with the following learning objectives:1)Team collaboration, communication, and cohesion2)Conducting independent research on a global problem and its solutions3)Synthesis of information from multiple sources and perspectives to develop an informed stance4)Developing a stance regarding a global problem and justification of this stance using data5)Creating a well-organized deliverable with consideration for the audience (i.e., their peers) and contextWe point to course survey data and student reflections to evaluate our course. Students conveyed how the course structure enabled them to (a) consider global perspectives around issues that may or may not have been salient to them before the course, (b) experience empathy for people experiencing challenges related to the issues of interest and gratitude for their circumstances, and (c) consider their personal role in addressing global issues in their communities. Students also indicated an interest in further addressing such issues through self-education and advocacy on a community and political scale.To further expand efforts to make global competency education accessible, our next implementation will utilize Collaborative Online International Learning experiences in which students virtually collaborate with students outside of the United States through our local Office of International Affairs. Through these collaborations, students will be challenged to consider how such global issues manifest in different communities, cultures, and geographic regions and the implications of these differences for solution design.},

  abstract={One of the problems faced by engineering and science students is focusing solely on technical knowledge while needing more cultural context. In today's interconnected world, addressing global challenges necessitates collaborative efforts from individuals across nations. Accordingly, a joint course between Chulalongkorn University in Thailand and the Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan has been established. The recent theme of the course, “Gamification towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” aimed to foster global citizenship and address SDGs through multicultural collaboration. This study examines the similarities and differences in problem identification between Thai and Japanese student groups participating in the course. Data was collected from discussions, presentations, and group assignments throughout the course. The findings indicate that while both groups share common concerns, such as waste management, language barriers, and transportation issues, their perspectives and proposed solutions are influenced by cultural characteristics. Thai students emphasized infrastructural inadequacies and local traditions, whereas Japanese students focused on efficiency and the impacts of tourism. The study highlights the importance of understanding cultural nuances in collaborative international projects to achieve effective and innovative solutions to global challenges.},

  abstract={This research delves into the complex connection between self-regulated learning (SRL), mobile learning (m-learning), and cultural factors among minority students, with Tibetan university students serving as the study participants. Through grounded theory analysis, we explored how cultural elements interact with the SRL processes of minority students in m-learning contexts. Our findings highlight the considerable impact of cultural challenges and adaptations on the m-learning experiences of minority students. Proactive self-regulation strategies were crucial in facilitating successful adaptation and overcoming learning obstacles. Furthermore, we identified influential factors such as prior knowledge, learning motivation, learning environment, and course quality as pivotal elements that shape the SRL processes of minority students in mobile learning. These factors relate to effective learning strategies and contribute to positive cultural identity and adaptation. These insights hold significant implications for multicultural education, emphasizing the importance of culturally responsive teaching approaches, fostering SRL strategies, and creating inclusive learning environments that empower minority students to thrive in m-learning settings.},

It also emphasizes the often overlooked preparatory and reframing activities that precede or follow the main coDesign negotiations in the process. The findings recommend treating all design phases as equally significant and adopting a flexible iterative approach to address the evolving goals of complex, longitudinal projects. They also highlight the value of multidisciplinary and multicultural teams with equitable power distribution.

  abstract={Diversity of thought is essential for innovation. Organizations are increasingly focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in their workplaces since DEI leads to significant tangible benefits and positive outcomes. In this article I would like to highlight why a commitment to DEI is so important for organizations, especially companies of all sizes. I also present some examples that define the business case for implementing DEI and discuss some of the ways in which industry can create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace culture.},

  title={Universal UX Design: Building Multicultural User Experience (Ferreira, A.) [Book review]}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={61},
  number={3},
  pages={348-349},
  abstract={The author of this book builds a case for designers, marketers, and stakeholders in the global marketplace to incorporate multicultural and international considerations into all aspects of their products and services. The book demonstrates the long-term benefits of internationalization, and it provides useful information about cultural and technological trends across all continents. In addition, the author offers practical advice on aspects of localization that should be brought into research and design. Employing anecdotal observations about a variety of cultures and a small variety of case studies, the author largely succeeds in his endeavor to bring greater consideration for international concerns to the fore of user experience. This book serves as a strong argument for marketers and designers to incorporate internationalization into an organization’s design philosophy so that its products will benefit from the start. However, the book only demonstrates the need for internationalization; it rarely offers suggestions on how to address a large variety of needs at once. Nevertheless, Universal UX Design has merit. Given its emphasis on product design for international markets, the book can serve as supplemental reading for graduate courses in UX design and technical marketing.},
