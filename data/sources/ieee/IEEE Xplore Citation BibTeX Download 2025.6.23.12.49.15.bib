  abstract={Creativity have been identified as an important ability to perceive the world in new ideas to make connections between phenomena. Many researchers generates solution in the area of creativity for the past century. According to the increasingly level of global, creativity is the process of bringing connectivity and new opportunities for acquiring multicultural experiences into being. Moreover, enhanced creativity has been shown to be one of the positive impacts of Multicultural Experiences (MCEs). However, current findings fall short of distinguishing different types of multicultural experiences towards the end of identifying which specific experiences enhance creativity. Many researchers indicate that multicultural interactions rather than exposures are associated with enhanced creative thinking. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to study on an overview of creativity in multicultural approach. Moreover, this research brings together the key factors that influence creativity. As a result, this study will later be used to explore how creativity is connected in Multicultural Experiences.},

  abstract={This research looks at the impact of artificial intelligence in bleisure travels in multicultural environments, with the key aim of seeing how advanced AI technology can improve people’s social lives and work and personal lives balance. The goals of the study are to determine how elements of artificial intelligence like customized travel advice, language translation, and actual cultural exchanges enhance the travelling experience.Problem Statement:Due to the rising modern trends of globalization, business people have the problem of managing time between work and recreation while on working trips, including those in multicultural environments. Bleisure travel and AI may be useful in how professionals engage with different cultures as they continue to perform their careers. Therefore, it is important to identify general social processes and difficulties that occur in this case to design better solutions.Methodology:This research adopts a quantitative research design with a supplementary qualitative element. It incorporates the narratives of bleisure travellers, questionnaires with the professionals in the industry, and the examples of the AI-based implementations of bleisure. The statistical findings form the basis of supporting the qualitative analysis to get quantitative results on social responsive occurrence, technological capabilities, and work–life balance.Outcome:The future studies conducted as a result indicate that AI improves the travelers’ experience not from the point of view of productivity only but also in terms of interactions and appreciation of culture. It is possible to note that AI-based developments have helped to a great extent to eliminate the obstacles to multicultural tourism, establish a reasonable ratio of work and free time, and adapt to social environments. Please, also, ethical concerns and guidelines for the application of Artificial Intelligence for bleisure travel with an aim to present a framework of socially responsible and responsible global mobility are presented.},

  abstract={Generative large language models (LLMs) show promise in multicultural teaching, but existing methods rely heavily on labeled data and resources, struggling to capture cultural nuances and generalize across various teaching contexts. To address the above issues, the paper introduces an innovative method called Multicultural Prompt Learning (MPL), which applies Chain of Thought (CoT) to prompt design. By gradually refining prompts, multicultural elements are integrated step by step, enabling AI to better understand and handle cultural nuances. This approach produces richer, more accurate, and diverse outputs, specifically aimed at enhancing students’ understanding of different cultures in multicultural teaching contexts. The experiment used a questionnaire, including image quality evaluation and a blind content comprehension, to compare Chain of Thought and traditional prompts. Results show Chain of Thought prompts outperform traditional methods in all dimensions, offering greater practical and educational value.},

  abstract={This study explores the feasibility and effectiveness of using federated learning technology to construct a social media user model of multicultural integration in China. By systematically reviewing related research on federated learning theory, social media user behavior analysis, and multicultural integration, the federated averaging algorithm was designed in detail and the model parameters were optimized to ensure efficient global model training while protecting user privacy. Research results show that the federated learning model significantly improves the accuracy and convergence speed of the model in application scenarios such as user behavior prediction and advertising recommendation. Through two typical cases of cross-cultural advertising recommendation and multicultural user behavior analysis, the practicability and advantages of the federated learning model are further verified. The data shows that this technology can not only improve advertising click-through rate and user interaction rate, but also deeply explore different cultural backgrounds. Understand the user's behavioral characteristics to provide strong support for personalized services and content recommendations. In summary, this study systematically proves the great potential of federated learning technology in modeling multicultural social media users, and provides a solid foundation for future research in related fields.},

  abstract={Due to the pandemic, we have become more reliant on digital technologies in every aspect of our lives. This has led to an increasing interest in teaching and training students and employees using immersive technologies and increasing multicultural learning and digital literacies in schools. This research-creation Ph.D. study aims to advance the understanding of the impact of interactive virtual reality non-fiction (VRNF) narratives as experiential learning tools to promote global citizenship education and to counter radicalization among high school and university students. The researcher will explore the effect of interactive VRNF narratives on open-mindedness trait and intercultural communication competence as moderators for multicultural learning in VR. This study also seeks to design and evaluate a VRNF narrative based on educators'/creators' feedback and contribution. This narrative will reflect a personal journey of multicultural learning in the Canadian context. A mixed method approach will be used: Delphi interview method and quasi-experimental study to examine the effects of interactivity and immersion on narrative transportation and user engagement. Results and recommendations will then be reported for further research and implementation.},

  abstract={As internationalization of higher education is becoming a commonplace, we frequently find ourselves situated in a “world” with students from different countries and -with different cultural backgrounds. Such a changing landscape in higher education opens up some opportunities for pedagogical design in technical and professional communication. Scholars have argued for teaching technical and professional communication as a humanistic, communalist, and interpretative process. Drawing on the prior scholarships, I propose a cross- cultural team project in a technical and professional communication class with native English speakers, multilingual students, and international students. In this team project students are not expected to land on cultural generalizations. Instead, students are encouraged to apply, appropriate, and “amend” existing linguistic and cultural theories in the decision-making of designing product description and instructions for a foreign audience. The ultimate goal of this intercultural communication practice is to guide student to understand and connect a cultural audience with information in a specific time and place.},

  abstract={Cultural diversity is pivotal in our society, making inclusive education a priority. Serious games offer unique avenues for fostering diversity in schools. JOINclusion, an Erasmus + funded project, developed and tested a mobile game across Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands. The game aims to facilitate harmonious and prosocial interactions in multicultural school settings. It consists of two learning scenarios, each consisting of four levels, each one targeting specific Social Emotional Learning (SEL) skills. Furthermore, a collaborative level is implemented, which allows children to practice the skills strengthened in the previous two scenarios. Thanks to a captivating and entertaining plot, children will have to search for magical gems scattered throughout the various rooms of the school and collaboratively solve social dilemmas based on the game's levels to save the school from an evil witch who is intent on destroying it. Additionally, an easy-to-use authoring tool for school educators has been developed to generate customized materials for the collaborative level. This study presents initial findings from the game's pilot phase, assessing its usability and educational value among children. Additionally, leveraging machine learning, the study examines children's game interactions to group them based on similar patterns. This grouping has the potential to predict behaviors related to social inclusion and identify influential game interaction features. Teachers can then use this information to gain a better understanding of how to create an enriching game experience and a more inclusive school environment. The results revealed that students who played the game enjoyed the experience, expressed a desire to play it again, and acquired new skills and knowledge. Cluster analysis showed three interaction profiles potentially predictive of expected behaviors and influential game features. Overall, the findings emphasize that JOINclusion provides an innovative platform to enhance empathic skills and cultural awareness among students.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a serious mobile game designed to promote the social inclusion of children from migrant backgrounds. By focusing on the development of empathic skills in native children at primary school, the game aims to bridge the gap between diverse groups and promote harmonious interactions. The game features two different gameplay scenarios, each of them consisting of 6 levels, which presuppose the acquisition of increasingly complex skills based on the Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) framework. The identified learning goals range from the identification of others' emotions based on expressive and social cues, passing through gathering information and understanding of cultural diversity, to team working and collaborative problem- solving. Through the engagement of players with the experiences of peers from diverse cultural backgrounds, the game provides a unique opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by children with migrant backgrounds. By providing students with a safe and interactive learning environment that promotes SEL skills, the current game has the potential to positively impact the classroom climate and promote cooperative learning among students.},

  abstract={Given the globalization background of transnational population flow and multi-ethnic cultural integration, the multilingual landscape has become an important feature of international cities. With an increasing number of foreigners coming to China, a relatively concentrated living area has gradually formed. This is a constant circulation, relatively balanced and unique multilingual community lifestyle, that is reflected in the language landscape. In view of this, this paper will take the Korean living community in the Wangjing District of Beijing, China, as an example, and take the language landscape there as the survey object. Through a comprehensive observation of this area, detailed description, statistics, and analysis are provided. The results show that: (i) in terms of the use of language signs, the bilingual signs of Chinese & Korean are mainly used, and Chinese language codes are dominant. Most of them are unofficial signs, and most of them are “Chinese and Korean” signs. There are a few official signs, mainly Chinese monolingual signs, supplemented by English signs. (ii) multilingual signs reflect the diversity of languages, styles and characteristics of China and South Korea. (iii) multilingual signs have the following functions: prompt information, reflecting life needs and consumer psychology, increasing the Korean national language identity, integrating a multi-element business atmosphere, creating a comfortable living space, and maintaining the strong position of Chinese.},

  abstract={This study focused on using War-Room Meetings (WRM) as a vehicle to developing team cohesion in multicultural project teams in Oil and Gas civil, and marine infrastructure projects. Although the concept of collaboration and multicultural diversity is extensively viewed as organisational social structures, most theories of developing cohesion are sceptical about the social process within which it might occur. We explored the theory of combing daily WRM and problem-solving while strengthening the social-structures in diverse, multicultural-teams. We started by examining mainstream literature to develop conceptual theories. This study also used interviews and an Action Learning group to collect data and evaluate ideas into action. Our findings suggested, team building, problem-solving, multicultural-teams, language barriers, and networking could improve by using WRM. These concepts influenced ambidexterity which balances between exploitation and exploration; therefore, manipulating ideas and using flexibility to test a variety of shared beliefs.},

  abstract={This paper describes method and results of assessment of global competency in engineering students who participated in a multicultural and multidisciplinary project based learning course. Subjects are total of 73 students with 14 nationalities from different fields of major. Assessment of collaboration and leadership competency under the global environment were evaluated by plural procedures. It became clear that the course had a certain efficiency to strengthen the global competency in engineering students. The results of correlation analysis suggested that possible factors which can bring out students' abilities under the global environment should be clarified as developing technical communication skill and providing global collaborative working.},

  abstract={The global Covid-19 pandemic has interrupted many aspects of life, including education. Students are asked to study at home, and the classrooms are conditioned to adjust to the changes. The use of technology is maximized so that students can still study effectively despite the situation. However, a challenge occurs when students claim that online learning creates distance between them and their lecturers, resulting in demotivation and unproductivity. They also feel emotionally disconnected to their peers and lecturers. By studying multicultural literature, it is expected that students can develop sense of empathy and broad-mindedness; thus, they can get connected to people more conveniently although they are separated by distance. This paper discusses experiences and methods of studying multicultural literature in virtual classrooms. Firstly, it investigates students' perception toward multicultural literature. The responses were collected from a questionnaire given to English-majored students from Bina Nusantara University, Indonesia. Next, it shares experiences from activities of virtual classrooms in two universities. The purpose of this paper is to shed a light on the importance of multicultural literature, especially during the pandemic-induced online learning.},

  abstract={Facial expressions convey exhaustive information about human emotions and the most interactive way of social collaborations, despite differences in ethnicity, culture, and geography. Due to cultural differences, the variations in facial structure, facial appearance, and facial expression representation are the main challenges to the facial expression recognition system. These variations necessitate the need for multicultural facial expression analysis. This study presents several computational algorithms to handle these variations to get high expression recognition accuracy. We propose an artificial neural network-based ensemble classifier for multicultural facial expression analysis. The facial images from the Japanese female facial expression database, Taiwanese facial expression image database, and RadBoud faces database are combined to form a multi-culture facial expression dataset. The participants in the multicultural dataset originate from four ethnic regions including Japanese, Taiwanese, Caucasians, and Moroccans. Local binary pattern, uniform local binary pattern, and principal component analysis are applied for facial feature representation. Experimental results prove that facial expressions are innate and universal across all cultures with minor variations.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper describes an inclusive on-campus intercultural development program that can be applied in engineering learning environments. A major outcome of engineering programs across the nation is to graduate professional engineers who are able to work and communicate effectively in multicultural environments and multidisciplinary teams. Therefore, developing multicultural/intercultural competencies is an important aspect of engineering programs. Generally, study abroad programs are seen as an effective means to develop intercultural/multicultural competence. However, the opportunity to study abroad is often not accessible for all students, particularly those from traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds. This paper describes the design, implementation, and assessment of an on campus intercultural development program, and the outcomes based on quantitative and qualitative data collected from two separate cohorts of engineering students during 2016 and 2017. The program is grounded in a developmental intercultural paradigm - Developmental Model for Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS) and Intercultural Development Continuum (IDC) - with an intentional focus on constructs identified on the Intercultural Knowledge & Competence VALUE Rubric. The outcomes and effectiveness are assessed using the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) and the Attitudes, Skills, and Knowledge Short Scale (ASKS2+). The overall results suggest that by intentionally focusing on the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of intercultural development, coupled with a developmental approach, it is possible to achieve intercultural.},

  abstract={Teaching a multicultural cohort is often a challenging task. This task becomes more challenging if the size of the cohort is large. Students in such cohorts often feel they are not having a personalised experience, isolated from the lectures and are usually dealt with as numbers. This results in a lack of enthusiasm and engagement as far as the students are concerned, and may jeopardise the teaching and learning process. Moreover, the lack of resources and staff shortages (high student-to-staff ratio) make the situation even worse. In such cases, the use of technology may provide solutions to the aforementioned problems in order to deliver a rich, personalised and engaging learning experience to the students. This paper presents a number of innovative teaching tools to enhance student experience. Student feedback has shown that the students are using these tools extensively, and their overall satisfaction is high.},

  abstract={Facial expressions are a vital part of nonverbal communication and are used to convey a wide range of emotions. Recent works have suggested that cultural and societal factors may influence how people express and interpret facial expressions of emotion. This study explores image features of facial expressions of the same emotion in two different cultures, Thai and Japanese, to identify features that are common and different among expressions across cultures. To achieve this goal, we collected facial expression samples from entertainment media in Thailand and Japan. The subspace techniques are applied to create feature spaces that represent facial expressions from these samples and to extract image features that can reveal differences in facial expressions between pairs of emotions in both cultures. Our study finds evidence that suggests sufficient distinctions between expressions of some emotions in both cultures, particularly happy and disgust classes, while the character of the surprise class is similar across Thai and Japanese samples.},

The virtual reality space is used to further promote cultural and information literacy education. Learning through games, guided tours and teaching can strengthen the identity of one’s own culture and promote the cultural assets of some ethnic minorities. This research uses a broad range of Indigenous ethnic groups as an introduction to understanding, and then goes deep into other related cultures, celebrations, and festivals as secondary promotions, inspects or observes ethnic-related architectural structures, totems, pottery and other cultural relics, and at the same time achieves digital preservation and Provision of educational resources. This research also uses 3D printing technology to print and reproduce cultural objects to help learners strengthen their cultural understanding and identification concepts while learning new technologies.},

  abstract={In interactive instruction, learning is enhanced through social interaction. Communication is key in this type of instruction: between the teacher and the students, as well as between students, without the direct participation of the instructor. In software engineering instruction, one of the many challenges is making students face situations similar to those in real life, with the goal of preparing them for their future work as software engineers. Whereas the traditional style of lecturing is still largely used in this field, hands-on, practical and interactive approaches have repeatedly proven to be more effective. This short paper is based on the experience of using such a teaching approach in a multicultural software engineering classroom, by considering the additional challenges brought by interacting with colleagues from different cultural backgrounds and speaking in a common, foreign language. The strategies employed throughout the course will be highlighted, along with various lessons learned, to be integrated in future software engineering classes.},

  abstract={Technical solution skills - though important - are not enough for effective, multicultural teamwork. Despite broad consensus on the vital function of communication- and social skills, they tend to be underrepresented in the training of software-engineers and project managers. This is partly because such skills are less explicit than technical methods, tools, and artefacts. To address this deficiency, an openly accessible web-based communication model for multicultural teams (comMCT) was developed. It consists of four modules addressing structural, functional, organizational, and interpersonal/behavioral aspects of multicultural communication. After presenting the empirically validated comMCT model, two scenarios of introducing comMCT into two academic courses within the computer science curriculum at the University of Vienna are discussed, along with the students' reactions and an online questionnaire capturing students' feedback on comMCT. In a nutshell, thoughtful, person-centered application of the model is expected to enhance learners' knowledge, practice, and reflection on communication issues and contribute to more effective and satisfied multicultural teams. Importantly, instructors as well as life-long learning program designers will find inspiration on including comMCT into their courses.},

  abstract={The Student Information System (SIS) has increasingly gained popularity among universities for various reasons. However, evaluating student's trust and satisfaction of the system are not fully investigated. In this research, a sample of 634 students participated in the study from Cyprus International University, Cyprus. The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique was employed with AMOS 23 software to identify the trust and satisfaction of students' SIS usage. The study model, which include subjective norm, image, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, trust and satisfaction, was developed based on extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM II). Results obtained from the analysis indicated that image, output quality, result demonstrability and perceived ease of use had a significant impact on perceived usefulness. Trust was found to be significantly correlated with satisfaction; however, subjective norm, Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use did not have a significant influence on satisfaction. Furthermore, the finding confirmed that several constructs in the TAM II that were important in previous studies were not significant in the SIS. The students' behavior aspects are essential for the effective use of the system. It provides valuable information for university management in understanding the challenges of student's trust and satisfaction about SIS usage.},

Whereby advanced driver assisted systems and electric mobility are already implemented and gaining an ever-increasing market share, autonomous cars are mostly still in the testing and development phase. Are humans ready for full autonomy on the road, or will the society resist the data-driven artificial intelligence approach of driving? This paper contributes to the acceleration of autonomous driving innovation and understanding of the underlying concepts. It will expose, explain, and uncover most technological and ethical aspects around autonomous, driverless cars considering compliance and regulatory affairs, which are inevitably impacting today's and tomorrow's society.},

  abstract={With the mode of teaching and learning in colleges and universities gradually changing to the multi-dimensional model, pluralism, internationalization, and modernization have become the inevitable trends of the future development of Chinese college English teaching. Based on the current situation of multicultural education in China, the thesis presents ideas for constructing a college English teaching model from three aspects. First, correct cultural teaching value is significant. For example, understanding and innovation of multi-culture influence the model construction of college English teaching under the multi-culture background. Second, clear teaching goals, teaching channels and English classroom groups are good for diversifying teaching strategies, which is also an important content of the college English teaching model. Thirdly, we need to establish a scientific cultural evaluation mechanism, enrich cultural connotation under the perspective of multicultural development, and expand ways for the college English teaching model. Constructing these three aspects of English teaching in colleges and universities is of reference value for Chinese English education.},

  abstract={A growing body of scientific evidence demonstrates that dolphins and whales (i.e., cetaceans) experience poor welfare when confined to concrete tanks in entertainment parks. Whereas most captive cetaceans cannot survive if released directly into the ocean a viable alternative is to transfer them from tanks to authentic sanctuaries. An authentic cetacean sanctuary is a place that provides a combination of a complex, natural environment continuous with the ocean and human care. Key to wildlife sanctuaries is the promotion of autonomy and giving back as much as one can of what was taken from its residents. In this presentation we describe the Whale Sanctuary Project (WSP), the world's first cetacean sanctuary effort for both captive beluga whales and orcas. Founded in 2016, WSP is a non-profit organization representing a groundbreaking collaboration among scientists, engineers, dolphin and whale advocates, legal experts, and many others. Its mission is to create a sanctuary for captive orcas and beluga whales in Canada and aid other cetacean sanctuary efforts globally. The WSP is preparing a 100-acre site on the eastern shore of Nova Scotia to welcome whales in 2025. Herein we describe the sanctuary site, highlight and update some of the milestones and challenges WSP has met over the years as the sanctuary progresses towards completion. We also discuss the importance of local community encouragement and participation for such a project as well as engagement with First Nations, who share the goal of rectifying our relationship with the ocean and the animals who live in it.},

  abstract={This full research paper reports on a study regarding students' views and experiences of teamwork in a challenge-driven course (also known as challenge-based learning). The students were situated in either the European university offering the course, or, in an African university where challenge-based learning was introduced for the first time. This study was performed as a case based study using thematic analysis to gain better understanding of students' views and experiences of challenge-driven, multicultural blended/online teamwork. The students were found to have different approaches during their teamwork: task-driven or relationship-driven approaches and, in addition, patience and solution-driven in regards to the digital technology. These findings can provide a deeper understanding for teachers that wish to organize collaboration between universities to support engineering students' collaborative learning in challenge-based/ driven education.},

  abstract={As part of the POGIL Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM (TIDES) project, seven instructors at five institutions adopted Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) activities for their first-year courses. These POGIL activities were designed to regularly prompt students to reflect on the relevance of the curriculum to their own lives, but instructors did not successfully incorporate students' cultures into their classes. Students were significantly more comfortable with computers after taking the course with the POGIL activities, even compared to students taking a similar course from the same instructors. However, there was no overall effect on students' attitudes towards the role of computers in their lives or their interest in taking more CS classes. Based on the instructors' implementations, the authors developed “Levels of Student Participation and Stages of Relevant Curriculum” to help all POGIL faculty assess how to make their classrooms more inclusive and make their curriculum more relevant. As instructors become more reflective about their practices and gain experience with POGIL, the authors expect that these POGIL activities and practices will improve students' attitudes towards computing and students' interest in CS careers.},

  abstract={School level ICT policy plans are increasingly attracting and gaining more attention of researchers around the world to integrate ICT in education from grassroots level. In spite of this, the schools are unaware about how to develop their own school level ICT policy plans and build ICT policy capacity. In this research the emphasis is given on how school level ICT policy plans are being developed and used in complex, dual medium of instruction and multi-cultural education system and also finds out the school level ICT policy plans' critical factor, challenges, potential and impact in rural areas schools. At the same time school community (e.g. teachers, principals, ICT coordinators) involvement in policy planning process are indicated as an important decision. Therefore, this study was carried out with three different organizations in Gilgit-Baltistan Pakistan using mixed methods. The data collected and analyzed from multiple sources (e.g. questionnaires with leadership, principals, questionnaires, ICT policy documents analysis and ICT coordinator questionnaires). The results show that school level ICT policy planning should carefully be considered versatile based on school culture. School level ICT policy plan and standard indicators have been listed based on survey findings, published literature, policy documents and school case studies.},

  abstract={The purpose of this article is to provide a reflective discussion, using a case study as a teaching and learning strategy to improve academic learner performance. Guided by the social constructivism paradigm and using critical race theory (CRT) as a theoretical framework that places race at the center of educational research and discourse, we provide conditions for the successful implementation of the case study as a teaching and learning strategy for culturally responsive, inclusive education that may improve academic learner performance for indigenous students. After receiving an Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program grant, one institution provided distributed, community-based instruction to rural areas and fostered a community of practice to support pre-service school library teachers. This article presents approaches and assessments based on the program that incorporated a culturally responsive pedagogy in its specialized curriculum and created information literacy resources to improve student success in racially diverse and economically disadvantaged northeast Oklahoma schools and communities. The article further reviews factors that influenced learning and teaching in this program. Significant contributions include the creation of a unique program that provides a framework for practicing professionals in K-12. Curriculum, resources, and information literacy tools are made available to help sustain educational efforts for those who serve in similar communities. The planning, design, development and distribution of digital format information literacy modules address education-based needs to enhance information literacy skills, to incorporate “faces of diversity” that help targeted viewers personally relate more positively to the learning experience, and to deliver current “standards based” training resources. Lesson plans and learning resources created during and after the program can continue to provide opportunities for cross-cultural dialogue between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous educators in shared study, mentoring, and faculty/teacher training.},

As one genre of multicultural multimedia, virtual Chinese palace scenes serve as a popular theme in Chinese 3D video games or 3D animations. However, manually designing the virtual Chinese palace scenes demands lots of effort from the game designers. In this paper, we propose a novel technical approach to automatically synthesize the virtual Chinese palace scenes on OpenStreetMap without demanding manual efforts. Our procedural modeling approach is able to convert any given modern urban architecture in the real world into a virtual Chinese palace architecture with a similar shape that results in a similar urban layout. In the experiment results, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in synthesizing virtual Chinese palace scenes in different real-world locations.},

It can be seen as a responsibility of universities’ staff to provide the needed knowledge, skills, and attitudes that would enable graduated engineers to identify the companies' needs to obtain effective innovations. To develop this last aspect, the University must allow students to have the opportunity to get acquainted with students from other countries working in the same innovation development project.In this paper, an experience is presented that analyses the collaboration among five university partners. Students of these institutions have collaborated in 8 innovation engineering projects that were carried out in the fall of 2019. In February 2020, a symposium was organized in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, where students showcased their innovations. In total, about 67 students from different nationalities collaborated in these 8 projects.

  abstract={The use of social media in disaster situations is inevitable, but it is also the case that information presented through this medium can include both public opinion and general information. In a multicultural nation like Malaysia, people like to use codeswitch sentences, through which they mix several languages to express their opinions. Sentiment analysis can be used to classify the subjectivity of social media data, by considering the multilingual aspect of Malaysian users who may experience disaster. In this paper, the authors propose a multilingual sentiment classifier used to understand how Malaysians react during a disaster. The proposed model collects disaster data from social media, which is then classified through a deep learning algorithm, so as to analyze the sentiments of people affected by disasters. The experiment results show that a multilingual sentiment classifier can achieve 0.862 accuracy and 0.864 F1-score which is considered suitable for analyzing social media data. The classification result shows that most Malaysians use social media to disseminate information during disaster periods.},

  abstract={Work in Progress: Engineering students need more than technical knowledge to meet the demands of the 21st century, they also require lifelong learning skills and inter-cultural knowledge. Intercultural learning is a global competence concept which is necessary for engineers to be able to work on complex global projects; immigrate to find work; collaborate and compete with multicultural colleagues; and work for international companies. Higher education institutions are exploring how to support and develop intercultural competences in students; however, in the engineering discipline studies are limited. Traditional study-abroad approaches have been adversely impacted by global events and challenges such as safety issues, health concerns, natural disasters, and political instability as well as students' financial and time constraints. In response, engineering education institutions and programs are exploring how to harness technology to satisfy academic and labor market needs in a scalable manner. This paper introduces the use of the Knowledge Community and Inquiry (KCI) pedagogical model developed by Slotta to design an inter-cultural learning course for student participants in the International Virtual Engineering Student Teams (InVEST) project. InVEST uses a blend of online social and collaborative experiential learning and synchronous video meetings to support students and educators involved in the project. The InVEST pilot project is aimed at bringing globally dispersed educators and their engineering students together to engage in cross-institutional and collaborative project-based learning via an online learning environment. The course is designed to assist students in gaining an appreciation of diverse cultures and working together on a project to co-construct new cross-cultural understanding.},

  abstract={Multicultural and history education is key to fostering empathy, inclusiveness, and global understanding in young students. It enriches ideas, drives economic growth, and preserves cultural heritage. To promote global cultural education, we propose a solution using big data and smart technology through crane machines equipped with dolls dressed in traditional costumes. These dolls are interactive, collecting text and speech data from users. By using sentiment analysis, we can better understand the emotional and interactive needs of users. We introduce a text sentiment analysis model based on multi-head attention and multi-scale CNN. The data undergoes preprocessing, and BERT generates word vectors. BILSTM and multi-attention mechanisms capture contextual dependencies, while multi-scale CNNs extract local text features to detect sentiment polarity. These features are fused to create a new feature vector for prediction. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end speech sentiment analysis model (EML) based on multi-task learning. Speech is processed through the Wav2Vec2.0 pre-training model to obtain temporal feature representations. In training, the model simultaneously performs speech translation and sentiment classification. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach.},

  abstract={Step indicators show users how far they have progressed in a multi-step process and are thus an essential element of interface design. However, research on step indicators is lacking, and optimizing these indicators in cellphone interfaces is essential to maximize their benefits to create a better user experience (UX). The focus of this study was banking apps. Through interviews with six financial experts and experts on user interface (UI) and UX, combined with prototyping and questionnaire surveys, we sought a balance between user-centered design and practical needs. The results show that step indicators are most effective when tasks are divided into more than three stages. Experts affirmed their effectiveness in reducing user anxiety and provided appropriate design solutions based on different step counts and language contexts. This study not only deepens our understanding of step indicators for different applications but also provides vital design guidelines for designers of mobile banking interfaces to enhance UX in multilingual and multicultural environments.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This research paper explores the experiences of engineering students and professionals in multicultural teams, aiming to understand successful strategies for working in such environments. With the engineering field diversifying rapidly due to globalization, there is a growing need for engineers to possess cross-cultural communication and collaboration skills alongside technical knowledge. This study aims to improve the effectiveness of engineering education and addresses the evolving needs for engineering education and the role of educators in preparing future engineers for multicultural teamwork. The following research questions guided our study: (i). What strategies do engineering students and professionals hold and employ in navigating multicultural teamwork?, and (ii) How do these specific strategies mentioned by engineering students and professionals align with the developmental orientations on the Intercultural Developmental Continuum (IDC)? The study employed a qualitative approach, with interviews and focus groups conducted with 41 engineering students and 17 professionals who reported prior experience working on multicultural teams. Participants discussed their experiences and strategies, which were categorized into social behavioral, cognitive, and affective attitudinal themes. A total of 17 strategy types were identified in the student data and 16 types in the professional data. Strategies were in turn mapped to different developmental orientations on the IDC, showing a relationship between strategies described by participants and associated stages of intercultural development. Our findings reveal likely gaps in multicultural teamwork abilities among both students and professionals. More specifically, engineering students and professionals may benefit from expanded intercultural development training to foster more ethnorelative approaches to teamwork. Future research could involve participants completing the IDI survey before interviews to better understand their individual levels of intercultural development, followed by efforts to design and pilot training and educational materials aligned with particular intercultural development levels. This research contributes to understanding successful strategies for working in multicultural teams, benefiting educators, practitioners, and engineering students alike.},

  abstract={Experiential learning has been a core notion in higher education for nearly half a century. However, the application of experiential learning practices on virtual classes is somewhat limited. In this paper, we test different practices of experiential learning intended for online learning. We draw on electronic end-of-module surveys, which have been completed by students upon completion of the class. The sample concerns the completed questionnaires of 197 post-graduate students. Based on these findings, we present a three-pillar model which relies on a) online communities, b) learning-by-doing as part of continuous assessment and, c) multicultural teamwork, to promote experiential learning by replicating a `workplace environment'.},

  abstract={If an engineer obtains correct conclusions, but cannot communicate these results in a proper way, then the value of the achievements could be diminishing dramatically. Awareness about the importance of acquiring soft skills in addition to technical knowledge is often present in engineering education, but the issue is still how the improvement of these key competencies should be addressed. Often our engineering classes are heterogeneous, both with respect to pre-knowledge of the mathematical and technical skills, but also concerning the cultural background of the students. This can be an additional challenge for the teaching situation. Instead of considering the cultural heterogeneity as an obstacle, we decided to use it as an advantage for enhancing soft skills in a mathematics course. In this paper, we describe a multicultural-based teaching approach for improving soft skills in engineering and computer science education.},

  abstract={Engineers and technologists are essential to solving many of the planet's most pressing problems; among them: clean water, sanitation, access to energy, carbon reduction, built infrastructure, disaster relief, transportation, and sustainable agriculture. These issues are headlines in the domain referred to as “humanitarian engineering”. Yet, despite the urgency, the majority of engineers do not spend their careers solving the problems where need is greatest. In what ways can young engineers be drawn towards working on the critical challenges being faced by so many people worldwide? By what means can a feeling of professional responsibility or duty be inculcated? How can the goals of humanitarian engineering be linked to young engineers' views of their own careers? This paper reviews one effort to address these questions by way of an online course linking questions of cultural dimensions, multicultural teams, and intercultural communication to humanitarian engineering, sustainable development goals (SDGs), and engineers' social responsibility. Pre- and post-assessments reveal several statistically significant trends that suggest the online course, entitled “Intercultural Engineering,” has some efficacy in shifting students' perspectives. As such, it appears to be a useful tool in supporting SDG 17, which seeks to revitalize global partnerships for sustainable development through shared values, visions, and goals.},

  abstract={Completion of group reports in multicultural classes in remote learning can be daunting for students and instructors. Although the needs and responsibilities of both parties differ, they effectively meet in the designing of appropriate assessment tasks and in the successful completion of the same. The process of group work in the online platform, as well as the challenges and possibilities presented to students and instructors differ from those of the face-to-face platform. The goal of the instructors and students is the completion of group tasks to achieve the intended learning outcomes and the successful academic satisfaction of undergraduate students. This paper addresses the efficacy of conducting research and completing group reports in academic study skills classes in the online platform, and it aims to explore the perception of undergraduate students towards the experience conducting research and completing questionnaires with the help of online tools. A sample size of fifty-eight undergraduate students were surveyed using a Likert-scale survey and the same students participated in completing reflective tasks, explaining their experience of conducting research and completing group reports using online tools. The findings revealed a set of positive and negative aspects of online collaboration; however, the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. The study findings can be useful for practitioners and curriculum designers of a variety of subjects and especially those of academic writing classes as it sheds light on the benefits and challenges of collaborative learning for completion of group reports in the online platform.},

  abstract={The portrayal of negative emotions such as anger can vary widely between cultures and contexts, depending on the acceptability of expressing full-blown emotions rather than suppression to maintain harmony. The majority of emotional datasets collect data under the broad label “anger”, but social signals can range from annoyed, contemptuous, angry, furious, hateful, and more. In this work, we curated the first in-the-wild multicultural video dataset of emotions, and deeply explored anger-related emotional expressions by asking culture-fluent annotators to label the videos with 6 labels and 13 emojis in a multi-label framework. We provide a baseline multi-label classifier on our dataset, and show how emojis can be effectively used as a language-agnostic tool for annotation.},

There are different models of STEM education according to the level of integration of the four disciplines. Moreover, educational systems are different depending on the country and associated external factors that affect the teaching processes. For this reason, the implementation of STEM education differs between countries. In this context, it is necessary to exchange ideas and experiences among the different regions in order to identify best practices and work together for improving STEM education. This work presents the results of a multicultural panel that was organized in Turkey to explore the differences and similarities between four countries from different continents: Egypt, United States of America (USA), Spain, and Turkey.},

  abstract={Different varieties of food and its quality speak the culinary tendencies and religious beliefs of people from different regions of the world. The food reflects culture and each food uses unique and combination of ingredients. It is a fashion and trend now a day to develop new food varieties, cooking methods and trying out cross culture recipe. Handling the food serving for a multi ethnic, multi culture and different belief people in a common environment like conferences, air lines, quarantine centers, even refugee camps etc. is a challenge and need concentration and attention. A safer way of using untiring intelligent machines to replace the food distribution to ease and protect chefs and kitchen staff is felt essential. We developed a system of intelligent visual food identification in order to avoid errors that may happen when handling big numbers of food distribution by deploying smart machines. We choose 17 assorted varieties of food images and trained the system to identify its correct type and nature. We used Convolution Neural Network with Tensor-flow and Keras and trained the network with 170 different food images. We trained the system with online and offline images and achieved training accuracy of percentage. The experiment results show 80 percentages and are not only limited to single entity but describing multiple possible labeling of food according to its nature.},

  abstract={Monoculture in a computer network is defined as executing the same protocols and software on all the networking devices. Multiple, correlated failures may be triggered in a monoculture network by attacks that exploit existing vulnerabilities in either protocols, software, or hardware. In this paper, optimal multiculture network design is used to improve the network reliability in the presence of correlated attacks. The multiculture network design is formalized using two sequential optimization problems: The first one for optimally selecting the number of network devices from each available vendor at the design stage, and the second one for optimally placing the devices in the network topology. Results show the capability of multiculture design in improving network reliability of eight actual topologies.},

In this paper we present the results of a study that investigated the reduction of the color spectrum in the HSV system for sample-based skin detection of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The proposed HSV filter reduced the color spectrum by 97.4648% so as to select candidates for human skin tones. It achieved low sensitivity (54.6333%) and high specificity (92.6390%) in human skin detection in color digital images when compared to the performance of other algorithms proposed in the literature. Different from other filters described in the literature which propose a single interval for human skin in the HSV system, this model presents and discusses 13 intervals in the possible spectrum which present a well-defined variation in terms of tone.},

  abstract={Managing projects in an intercultural environment creates additional challenges for international project teams. International project teams working in such an environment should deal with issues connected with differences in time-zones, technology compatibility, communication [1], etc. Furthermore, project team members come from different cultural backgrounds, which is why, in multi-cultural projects, an individual may need to navigate multiple cultural and value norms [2]. Such cultural dimensions as trust and fears, lack of participation and commitment, and insufficient information sharing are reported to influence project team work, too [3]. Competence management exercises the notion of competence for different purposes, for example, in assessment and development centers, and for learning and development needs [4]. However, there is a lack in the literature on how to deal with challenges and issues that appear in international project teams in a multi-cultural environment. In this paper, the author analyzes existing competency-based frameworks and approaches and studies factors that play a role in managing international project teams. The findings show that a competency-based approach can be used to mitigate cultural misunderstandings with the help of the intercultural competence profile that is related to the respective competence elements mentioned in competence-based standards.},

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization launched the “creative cities network”, and divided it into seven categories: media arts, literature, crafts, folk art, music, gastronomy, film, and design in 2004. Most of historic districts in Taiwan have met the creative atmosphere. The transition from historical districts to creative streets may have been taking shape. However, innovation and development of historic blocks focus more on economic development and tourism industry. The creative atmosphere in the old streets cannot be demonstrated. This study observes the process of shaping of creative clusters and proposes some phenomena. It adopts the method of “case studies” and selects “Xinyi Street of historical district” in old five channels cultural zone of Tainan City, Taiwan as a subject. The result of this paper hopes to provide a kind of observable perspective in the old street transformation, and make contribution to the future development of Taiwan's historic districts.},

  abstract={Nowadays particular attention is paid to self-education and the development of skills that help a person to perceive information faster and more efficiently. A change in the learning paradigm implies the development of metaskills and metaknowledge. Implementing Federal State Educational Standards (FSES) of the third generation also reinforces the need to study and develop metacompetences and metaskills for students in order to be competitive in the labor market and in demand as specialists. Metacompetences as some new qualities that develop on the basis of the basic professional and personal qualities necessary to improve efficiency, work capacity or learning ability are inextricably linked with metacognitive processes. The development of the ability to manage one’s cognitive processes can be implemented using teaching methods aimed at the student’s independent activity. The project method is one of these teaching methods. Project activity in higher education is a part of innovation activity. Implemented in different directions, project activity at the university contribute to the development of the required competences by students in terms of the ability to design and innovative activity, and can also be the basis for innovation in the areas of specialization of the university.},

  abstract={The many applications of remote sensing techniques to unearth understanding of the environment has not only increased by leaps and bounds over the past two or so decades, but they have also now become indispensable to routine and comprehensive geophysical studies. Today, all geophysical disciplines utilize remote sensing applications in some form or another, and the trend in such usage is certainly expected to be positive going forward. It is, therefore, critical that the next generation of remote sensing tool developers and users be adequately attracted, recruited, retained, and trained to meet current 21st century environmental challenges and those challenges that lie ahead. It is also equally important (for a plethora of reasons) that this prospective new cohort of remote sensing developers and users be both ethnically diverse and highly skilled. To this end, the New York City College of Technology (City Tech) of the City University of New York has used a National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (NSF REU) grant to develop and implement an intrusive remote sensing research mentoring program that targets minority students. Programmatic results indicate that the remote sensing mentoring program has been highly successful in increasing the mentees' remote sensing knowledge and research skills, their communication of remote sensing concepts and ideas, and their research creativity, autonomy, and intellect.},

  abstract={Soft regulations, commonly known as Corporate Governance (CG) codes, aim to enhance shareholders' confidence by regulating corporate world. These regulations have turned much of the attention towards the improvement of boardroom diversity particularly after economic turmoil 2007–08. Malaysia like other countries, also recommended improving boardroom diversity in its recently introduced third CG code (Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance) in 2012. Thus, this paper proposes to investigate boardroom diversity (age, gender & ethnicity) and its relation with shareholders' confidence measured by share market price in the non-financial listed companies of Malaysia from 2010 to 2013. The proposed period of analysis represents two years pre and two years post enactment period of the code which will highlight the impact of the code, if any. The proposed study will fill the literature gap as most of the previous literature in the area has investigated the relationship between boardroom diversity and firm performance rather than shareholders' confidence.},

  abstract={With the increasing interconnectedness of the world, globalization has become a prominent factor influencing various sectors, including engineering education. This paper explores the multifaceted impacts of globalization on engineering education, examining both the challenges and opportunities it presents. The globalization of engineering education is reshaping curricula, teaching methodologies, and the skills demanded of future engineers. We examine the significance, benefits, and challenges of international activities for engineering students, such as study abroad programs, international internships, and collaborative projects with institutions worldwide. The impact of international experiences on students' technical skills, cultural awareness, adaptability, and overall professional development is described. The findings indicate that international activities offer invaluable opportunities for students to broaden their horizons, gain exposure to diverse engineering practices, and develop essential soft skills required in today's globalized engineering landscape. The role of international collaborations in fostering innovation, promoting interdisciplinary learning, and addressing global engineering challenges is presented. The challenges discussed relate to cultural diversity, curriculum standardization, and the integration of global perspectives into local contexts. This paper concludes with recommendations for curriculum development, pedagogical practices, and policy initiatives aimed at promoting a globally competent engineering workforce equipped to address the complex challenges of the 21st century.},

  abstract={Computer Science is a field that still has long strides to make before its workforce reflects the racial, ethnic and gender diversity found in the United States. To address this problem the authors developed culturally relevant class activities and homework problems that teach students to use loops, lists, functions and conditional logic, by remixing popular Black music in an introductory Python course. The activities were developed with the thought that students would be less intimidated by the content, if they saw their culture reflected in the course materials. Using an online survey, students were asked to compare their experience working on the problems that used Black music as a context, with their experience completing textbook problems on the same content. All of the survey respondents were Black female undergraduate students enrolled in a STEM major at a historically black college. Students reported that they were better able to identify with the examples and problems using Black Music as a context. Study participants also indicated that making enjoyable music motivated them to work harder than they would on textbook problems. Of the 33 study participants, 60% had no prior experience programming, and 63% of the students expressed an interest in taking further computer science coursework as an elective. The authors explain the sequence of assignments they used to help students understand introductory computer science concepts, and share lessons learned from using Black Music as a tool in the classroom.},

  abstract={Heart rate measurement is crucial for assessing physical health. Traditionally, contact-based method such as PPG requiring skin attachment have been predominant. However, these methods have limitations due to their invasive nature. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a non-contact alternative that broadens its application possibilities. Yet, current rPPG methods have not been extensively tested across diverse populations, where varying skin pigmentation can affect measurement accuracy. This study aims to determine the most effective rPPG method for extracting heart rate from individuals of diverse origins. Evaluating Chrominance-based (CHROM), Plane Orthogonal to Skin (POS), and GREEN methods using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), we found that the POS method demonstrated superior predictive accuracy with an RMSE of 8.45, while GREEN showed comparable performance with an RMSE of 8.89 across different country groups.},

  abstract={Long lectures and dictations, memorization by heart and little interaction in the classroom often leave students less involved and committed. These deficiencies were highlighted by COVID-19 with the online classes. In this study, we propose an active learning activity to improve students’ understanding of business concepts. We applied the activity in an online class, at a renowned university in Portugal, to first-year students from management and economics courses. Students answered a quiz, before and after the activity, to measure the level of comprehension of the topic. The high scores of the post-quiz reflect the good acquisition of knowledge. The survey found that most students (96%) agree that active learning methods can be more efficient at acquiring and understanding management concepts. Students also raised several positive points about active learning methods.},

The lecture aims to approach the question of fake news in history, which methods were used and what lessons can we learn from them nowadays in the times of digitalization and information overflow.The contribution focuses on migration, as an example on the case study of Sudeten Germans. Here we can see the transformation of a close relationship between ethnic as well as linguistic groups over centuries into national hatred. News, fake news and propaganda played an essential role in these developments. In the break of culture of National Socialism and the resulting post- war violence, this culminated in the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia. These developments led to friend and foe schemes over generations until today - which are expressed offline as well as online.},

  abstract={Diversity in technology programs is as confounding to technology programs as it is to any other STEM fields. Some believe that strengthening the basic skill sets of students in math [1] will raise awareness of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in the United States. While others find other issues such as debt cause a large influence in lack of persistence in STEM programs, both graduate and undergraduate.[2, 3] A review of the data available on engineering technology and other technology graduate students provides clarity to the diversity issue. While the authors found some students progress onto graduate school, nearly 60% were enrolled in the 3/2 programs. These are programs where students complete a bachelor and master degree in 5 years. Our study also showed students, primarily those that are a minority by race or gender, do not continue their education through graduate school. These findings raise some questions about these students and what steps will encourage their persistence or return to graduate study. Therefore, further examination of available data, future interviews with current students and graduates will provide a better understanding of the lack of diversification and persistence in technology graduate programs. Utilization of data gathered in the large institutional database provides a means to understand how the perception of students influences their decision to persist, continue, and complete further study. Increased understanding as it relates to students decisions to persist allows institutions to develop strategies to change student perceptions and decisions to persist. Administration will then have the information needed to support the development of programs that will encourage persistence and greater diversification of the graduate student population in technology.},

In our contribution, we will concentrate on the cultural influence on teaching databases. Open questions that we want to discuss are: Which cultural viewpoints have to be considered (national, different users' groups); how culture influences expert work; and finally, yet importantly, do we have general solutions for those open questions? Besides the presentation of basic cultural concepts like culture, cultural differences, cultural awareness and others, we will also present the experiences of a student test group and students from the Erasmus+ program, who answered the question about cultural viewpoint inclusion into conceptual modelling (local students), or take part in the interview (Erasmus students).},

In order to improve the convergence of data, multi-objective processing is carried out in the cloud computing environment. Combined with the fuzzy adaptive sorting algorithm, the difference value of multi-objective variation is calculated to achieve the balanced adjustment of variation data. In order to speed up the data convergence, balance the local optimal sorting value, obtain the initial value of scattered defect data, and complete the adaptive sorting of scattered defect big data. Finally, experiments show that the adaptive sorting method based on cloud computing can better repair and accurately sort the scattered data, and improve the data convergence effect.},
