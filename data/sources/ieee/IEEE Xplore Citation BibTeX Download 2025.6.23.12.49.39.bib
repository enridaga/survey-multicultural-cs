  abstract={Geographic names in past are important information in various fields in social sciences as they can be found in documents of those days. To digitize such old geographic names as a snapshot database must be a first step of digitization; however, there are many awaiting solutions to link old names with current geographic names toward a spatio-temporal digital gazetteer. In this article, major source materials of old geographic names are maps of Thailand which were published in early twentieth century. Village names on these maps are names in almost 100 years ago. Even locational accuracy is not enough reliable, many historical and ethnic information on local communities can be retrieved from old maps. Facts and prospects mainly on old geographic names of Northeast Thailand are discussed.},

  pages={112-115},
  abstract={People from various ethnic and diverse countries are living in the area we live in today. How can a city, a complex of such diverse members, achieve a sustainable local community? Currently, there are about 460,000 Koreans living in Japan. The largest number live in Ikuno district, Osaka. After the end of World War II to the present, Koreans in Japan have been subjected to discrimination and hatred in Japanese society, such as national education, fingerprinting refusal movement, and hate speech. By solving these social conflicts and problems, they needed an opportunity to strengthen their sense of fellowship through confirmation of their identities, and to inform the society and region of their presence. At this time, `Matsuri', played a big role in expanding communication with other groups for maintaining their identity. `Matsuri' is a traditional Japanese festival based on the religious purpose and the bond of local residents. In this article, we examine how the festivals in many ethnic groups played a role in reducing the conflict between the Japanese local community and the ethnic group. We will discuss a sustainable society where ethnic groups can live all together, through the analysis of `Ikuno Cultural Festival' and `Ikuno Korea town Festival' held in Osaka.},

  abstract={The aim of the proposed 360-degree virtual reality (VR) documentary explores questions of identity in the multiethnic environment of Taiwan, the connection to perception, tradition, and globalization, as well as how these in turn characterize culture in Taiwan as distinct in the region. The VR framework presented here was conceived by Richard Cornelisse for providing an installation of multi-dimensional experiences of a diverse Taiwanese milieu, that captivates and transports the viewer to a subtle, yet heightened, awareness of local nuances between people, location, and religious rituals. These experiences are meant to re-contextualize how one can understand Taiwan in terms of the people, culture, diversity, and landscape of as both viewer and participant. Our interactive platform activates viewer participation and allows them to engage the subject matter in a unique individualized experience of people and place: one that not only questions how one can understand issues of identity and traditions in a rapidly changing globalized cultural landscape, but also how one can experience local culture and geography through a malleable, immersive, non-linear narrative.},

  title={The Fading Of Chinese Ethnic Minority Culture - A Case Study Of Five Inner Mongolia Novels}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={422-422},
  abstract={Culture fading among ethnic minority population is critical to the social diversity, and it may cause social problems like reduced national identity and cultural confidence. China, experiencing fast economic development, is confronted with challenge of losing its splendid ethnic minority culture inheriting from thousands of years ago. Though government is calling for attentions and made laws to help protect the minority culture in China and built museums. but the young generation of Chinese people tend to migrate to urban areas for career development, where innovation, technology and efficiencies are more valued than ethnic diversity. This paper builds upon ”Boundless Grassland”, ”The Believer’s Last Word”, ”JunMa, CangLang, GuXiang”, ”Fu Qin Yu You Er Qu”, ”Da Sheng Kui Shang Hao”, providing evidence of culture fading by analyzing the frequency of appearance of Mongolian Culture related images in those novel. The reasons of choosing novels as the data sources are the popularity of the novels is high enough, those novels are all written by Mongolian writers in China, and the the concentrated description or implication about the status quo of Mongolian Culture that are presented along the action of the characters in the novels. Based on Edward W Said’s Orientalism, deep literature analysis methods of content analyses were used to ground change of Mongolian culture from the images presented in the novels that falls into 6 sectors: symbols, language, beliefs, values, and artifacts. I found that first, the fading of Chinese ethnic minority culture starts when modernization starts. Second, internal Orientalism caused culture fade and posed a strong threat to the preservation of Ethnic minority culture. Third, the process of objectification and internal Orientalism and their impact can be generalized to other culture. This work contributes to the literature of Orientalism, where China’s data and state-of-art is rarely documented. Mongolian culture is one of the most influential culture on the world that impacted over half of the world throughout its history. The conservation of Mongolian culture is vital for the ethnic Mongolians, and will serve as a road map for the later preservation of the Culture of Ethnic Minority.},

  abstract={This research proposes an automated attendance management solution using facial recognition, tailored to the Senegalese educational system. Given the challenges of traditional methods in overcrowded classrooms, our approach integrates artificial intelligence through the OpenCV DNN module, providing a balance between accuracy and required resources. The developed architecture combines an intuitive user interface, realtime video processing, and automated report generation, relying on a Flask server and a MySQL database. The solution is adapted to local constraints, particularly ethnic diversity, and integrates with existing surveillance systems. Tests demonstrate high facial detection accuracy while respecting ethical considerations and complying with Senegalese legal frameworks for personal data protection, thus contributing to the modernization of the educational system.},

  abstract={The digitalisation efforts of the 21st century have valorised the role of competences, as companies are only willing to employ employees with a wide range of knowledge, who can be trained and retrained in gradually changing workplaces. These workers are also more likely to have job security than unskilled and sometimes untrained workers. Competency has become a key concept in human resource management because it helps to identify the factors and pathways that can lead to a high performing, competent workforce. Nowadays, new competencies are being identified, such as a project-oriented approach, innovative behaviour and even an agile mindset. These concepts have not been encountered so far, or at least not to such an extent. The aim of our study is to identify and assess, through the eyes of different generations, which competences lead towards agile behaviour, based on the results of a primary research, highlighting the readiness and preparedness of different age groups to operate in an agile way.},

  abstract={Emotional stress is a common issue that can have negative impacts on an individual's health, productivity, and overall well-being. Detecting emotional stress in real-time can help provide timely interventions to alleviate its negative effects. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of using the variance of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for analysis of facial images for emotional stress detection. Four DCNN models, namely VGG16, ResNet50, AlexNet, and VGG19, were used to analyze facial images and measure their variance to detect emotional stress. The results showed that the variance of DCNN analysis of facial images is an effective method for detecting emotional stress. The study highlights the potential of using DCNN models for real-time emotional stress detection and can be applied in various fields, such as healthcare, education, and security, to detect emotional stress and provide timely interventions.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for more easily accessible testing tools for developmental screening because the number of certified public psychologists and testing institutions is limited. To solve the problems, we have focused on drawing tests for screening and developed a tablet-type drawing data acquisition system to collect drawing data from young children. In this study, we investigate the relationship between developmental age and features extracted from stroke data in drawing. Specifically, based on the pen tip's position with each elapsed time from the test's start, we extracted each drawn figure's features, such as speed during drawing, for performing a multiple regression analysis using these features and living age in months as an explanatory variable and developmental age in months as the objective variable. As a result, we found that living age in months contributed the most to estimating developmental age in months.},

  abstract={Souls-like games are one of the most popular and emerging genres in the contemporary gaming world. This study compared the behavioral characteristics, perspectives, and emotional expressions of players in Souls-like games from different cultural backgrounds, specifically examining the distinctions and commonalities among them. Natural language processing techniques were employed to analyze English, Chinese, and Russian reviews of 17 Souls-like games to investigate players' gaming experiences, including gameplay behaviors, game evaluations, and emotional experiences. The findings revealed significant disparities among players from different cultures in all three aspects of their engagement with Souls-like games. Specifically, these players exhibited significant culture-related variations in their behavioral characteristics toward Souls-like games. In terms of perspectives, English-speaking players tended to focus more on game optimization, whereas Chinese and Russian players paid greater attention to game combat design. Regarding emotional expressions, Chinese players were more prone to exhibit emotions of anger and disgust, while English and Russian players displayed a more neutral emotional stance. These cultural insights provide valuable information for game developers to better meet the needs and expectations of players from different cultural backgrounds. This study not only broadens our understanding of player behaviors and cultural influences but also lends robust support to cross-cultural gaming research.},

  pages={108-117},
  abstract={Contribution: An analysis of the extent to which sustainability is present in the syllabi, project briefs, report templates, and student final reports of the three Iberian European project semester (EPS) providers, over a five-year period. Background: EPS is a one-semester capstone project framework that adopts project-based learning and multicultural, multidisciplinary teamwork. Educating engineers for sustainable development requires fostering critical and ethical thinking and a desire for equity, solidarity and preservation of natural resources, and cultural and genetic diversity. Existing engineering capstone design programs emphasize solving real world problems, hands-on training, and soft skills, but few focus on sustainability aspects of engineering design. The three Iberian EPS providers adopt project-based learning and teamwork methodologies, promoting the development of transversal skills and addressing sustainability in a multicultural and multidisciplinary background. Intended Outcomes: To show that the three Iberian EPS providers follow these recommendations and contribute to raising students’ awareness of sustainable development. Application Design: The proposed sustainability learning assessment method collects evidence from syllabi, project briefs, report templates, and final reports to extract faculty and student perspectives. The sustainability-related terms collected were processed into word cloud format, allowing a simple and intuitive interpretation of students’ understanding of sustainability, and in co-occurrence network format, to understand if sustainability has a pervasive or confined presence within the reports. Findings: Iberian EPS faculty and students are aware of the social, economic, and environmental impact of their projects, in terms of quality of life, social responsibility, the use of resources, and environmentally friendly technology.},

Hence, a qualitative research design was used to achieve the research objectives. The study employs in-depth Interviews with 60 participants from Gulf Air (GA) to collect the required data for this research effort. The open-ended qualitative questions used, have enabled participants to provide supplementary evidence around cultural intelligence and were valid for interpretation. This study provides an understanding of how individuals perform in multicultural environments, which can be helpful to managers in formulating new motivational strategies to enhance employee performance. The results show significant characteristics that predict employees’ ability to function effectively in a multicultural work environment. These findings have implications for GA and other companies looking for survival and growth in the global marketplace. Given the research findings, senior leaders of GA (and other airlines companies) should give CQ a priority, define and develop its goals, and value employees with high CQ to improve organizational performance in international assignments.},

  abstract={The growth in employment for the renewables industry combined with transition from other energy sources, is predicted to result in over 100 million employees in the sector worldwide by 2030 [1]. These employees will come from a variety of disciplines, cultures and backgrounds and will require a range of education and training to help us address climate change. Higher Education Institutions (HEI) will be a primary provider of this education/training and whilst there is an increasing number of renewable energy courses being developed, many of them focus on one discipline. They therefore potentially miss the benefits of multidisciplinary and intercultural group learning to help develop the “durable skills” required by industry [2]. This paper charts the on-going journey of an award-winning approach to learning [3] associated with the renewables sector that has been developed in Universities and industry in Europe. The Promoting Excellence in Employability and Transversal Skills (PEETS) initiative co-created a variety of innovative learning opportunities for students and staff enhancing both knowledge and skills development. Experiential and problem-based challenges through eg the construction of 5m tall wind turbines at a 10 day intensive study period, supported deeper learning through reflection. This initiative was awarded the prestigious Collaborative Award for Teaching Excellence (CATE) by AdvanceHE in 2019. Such a model of interdisciplinary learning is readily transferable across the sector and can assist in the development and application of environment-friendly energies.},

  abstract={Introduction: Virtual teams, especially project teams, increasingly rely on computer-mediated communication for interaction when collaborating and completing their tasks. Team members represent various cultures, occupations, and industries. Virtual teams often use English as a business lingua franca in communication. This study investigates critical factors related to virtual project teams that influence computer-mediated communication. Research questions: 1. How is diversity in video meetings experienced by the members of multidisciplinary and multicultural project teams? 2. Do differences in team members’ occupational or industrial backgrounds show in their opinions on video meetings? Literature review: The effectiveness of communication has been identified as playing a critical role in the success of virtual projects. Diversity, whether disciplinary or cultural, enriches teamwork by bringing different viewpoints to discussions. On the other hand, diversity can also set some challenges for communicating these viewpoints. Research methodology: Mixed methods were used to analyze data obtained from 104 responses to an online survey. Spearman's correlation coefficient and Kruskall-Wallis nonparametric tests were used for statistical analysis, and open comments were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results and conclusion: The findings show that linguistic, cultural, and occupational diversity facilitates communication in virtual project team meetings. In addition, applying appropriate features of video meeting tools in different stages of project teamwork leads to better communication in virtual teams. A high level of English proficiency is not required, but clear communication rules are essential. In addition, some occupational or industry-specific differences in opinions on communication could be identified.},

  abstract={The purpose of this paper is to assess the learning outcomes of a problem-based learning (PBL) program within multi-cultural setting for students majoring in engineering. To meet the pressing needs of global issues such as population change, energy, and environment, the tasks required for engineers have expanded in recent decades to include working in multicultural environments. There, along with technical skills and knowledge in their fields of expertise, engineers are required to be equipped with skills and minds able to work in these fields. As such, higher educational institutions have conducted educational reform to develop active learning along with inter-country university programs. Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan and Chulalongkorn University in Thailand developed a joint PBL program titled “Global Awareness for Technology Implementation in the Solving of Social Issues”. The uniqueness of this PBL program is that it combined the virtual on-line group work and face-to-face meeting. This paper summarizes the process of curriculum development, pedagogy utilized in the course, as well as research findings and its reasons. Through this process the paper aims to discuss challenges and opportunities for future prospects of global engineering education utilizing digital devices to promote inter-cultural PBL.},

  abstract={Work, to an increasing amount, is based on collaboration between different partners; collaboration emphasizes the importance of communication between the collaborating parties. Increasingly, work is also becoming distributed and carried out in different geographical locations; distribution underlines the importance of managing and organizing work. The third important aspect characterizing current work is globalization; this refers to the multicultural characteristics of work and the need to understand the behavioral patterns of different (national) cultures. The paper addresses these three challenges related to the current work context. The approach points out the importance of a deep understanding of the characteristics of work - collaboration, distribution, and cultural diversity. Adaptive learning provides one potential solution to the challenges.},

  abstract={Graduates of computer science and software engineering degrees are often expected by employers to possess various technical skills as well as competencies in project management, testing, teamwork, and other soft skills. Extant literature has identified that these competencies are often not addressed by traditional teaching approaches such as lectures and labs. In this paper, we present a project-based learning approach to teaching agile software development where students work in multicultural teams to develop software for clients. This approach to teaching software development addresses some of the competencies required by employers, and the feedback from students, clients, and tutors are discussed and analysed critically.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic that has ravaged the world since December 2019 caused disruptions in the engineering education sector as students in African universities were unable to learn virtually. From two recent multi-language, multi-cultural pan-African online surveys to assess the impact on students, over 6,000 responses showed the twin constraints of irregular electric power supply and poor internet connectivity to effectively participate in virtual learning. This project is aimed at developing an affordable and reliable power and communication device for continuous online learning for engineering students, showcasing the strength in Africa's diversity through a collaborative, multinational, multicultural, multi-lingual and gender-sensitive platform to solve this identified global African Engineering Education challenge. A collapsible 100-watt solar photovoltaic module charging a set of lithium batteries via the charge controller was used to power a laptop computer, a mobile phone and a 5-watts bulb simultaneously through a Direct Current/Direct Current (DC/DC) converter. An embedded modem in the device provided the wireless network for internet connectivity. The initial prototypes produced weighed less than 7 kg, and preliminary performance tests showed that the gadget was able to charge up a laptop and two smartphones totaling 45.5WH from 0% to 100% while the remaining backpack state of charge remains 12.8V at 88% (that is 12% depth of discharge). The power supply and communication device for continuous online learning for African engineering students will not only bring engineering solution collaboration among hundreds of engineers, technologists, and technicians from the entire African continent, but will also boost entrepreneurial skills for many African engineering practitioners when fully commercialised.},

  title={Linking the Getty Vocabularies: The Content Perspective, Including an Update on CONA}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This paper focuses on issues surrounding the rich content of the Getty vocabularies, [1] particularly as they have transitioned from more traditional data releases to become optimized for release as LOD and beyond. The Getty vocabularies have been a mainstay of cataloging, indexing, and access for art, architecture, and other cultural heritage information since the 1980s. They are compiled resources that grow through contributions from the expert user community. They are multicultural and multilingual, currently being translated in several languages. With the release of the AAT (Art & Architecture Thesaurus®), ULAN (Union List of Artist Names®), and TGN (Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names®) as Linked Open Data (LOD), [2] the Getty vocabularies are entering a new world of seemingly limitless possibilities in digital scholarship. With the addition of new resources, CONA (Cultural Objects Name Authority®) and the Getty Iconography Authority (IA), the Getty vocabularies are poised to truly become linchpins in joining disparate resources from diverse disciplines, including art museums, special collections, libraries, archives, conservation, archaeology, visual resources, universities, and other researchers. The Getty vocabularies may serve as conduits through which data about art, architecture, and other cultural heritage are created and accessed for research and discovery. From their inception, the Getty vocabularies were designed to be linkable to each other and to the broader realm of cultural heritage information. For example, in the AAT, concepts are linked to each other through hierarchical and associative relationships with defined relationship types that inform the user that a rhyta (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300198841) is a type of ancient drinking vessel having an animal shape and is distinguished from vessels in other cultures having a similar purpose or appearance, such as stirrup cups and sturzbechers. In ULAN, the record for a person such as Katsushika Hokusai (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ulan/500060426) may include various go names and aliases, and links to records for his teachers, family, and a novelist with whom he collaborated. In TGN, a geographic place record for Siena (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7011179) may include ancient names, as well as links to multiple broader hierarchical contexts, for the modern nation of Italy as well as the ancient confederation of states, Etruria. In the IA, an Aztec character Ometecuhtli (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ia/901002056) may be linked to named legends in which he is a character, as well as to other characters or places to which he is related. In CONA, titles/names and other information for works of art, including architecture, movable works (paintings, sculptures, textiles), and conceptual works (multiples) are linked to AAT, ULAN, TGN, IA and external sources, linking rich information from multiple sources to describe works whether extant, destroyed, or designed but never built. An example is the Old Trikuta temple (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/cona/700002003).},

  pages={7123-7134},
  abstract={Advancements in artificial intelligence have enabled its integration into research and educational settings, particularly in supporting students with dyslexia. This scoping review explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence in dyslexia research and education, outlining its applications, opportunities, and challenges. A search across Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and ERIC yielded 683 unique articles, of which 84 met the inclusion criteria. The findings reveal four primary applications of AI in dyslexia education and research: early detection and diagnosis, personalised learning and interventions, speech and language processing as well as brain imaging and neuroimaging analysis. Additionally, five significant challenges were identified: data quality and quantity, accessibility of artificial intelligence-powered support, bias and validity in assessments, balancing artificial intelligence assistance with human expertise, and transparency in artificial intelligence decision-making. Actionable steps are recommended to enhance dyslexia research and education to address these challenges. Key approaches include improving artificial intelligence tools for early detection, ensuring inclusivity in affordable systems, addressing ethical concerns, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, training educators and developing culturally relevant tools. Future research should focus on the creation of tools for non-English-speaking and multicultural contexts, advancing research in neuroimaging and personalised learning, longitudinal studies on artificial intelligence interventions, and the establishment of ethical frameworks for the responsible deployment of artificial intelligence in dyslexia education. By navigating these complexities of artificial intelligence integration, we can unlock its full potential to revolutionise dyslexia education and create more inclusive, effective, and ethical learning environments for all.},

  abstract={Economy, development, and sustainability are realities that are heavily intertwined. All those realities are the playground of engineers. The world we live in is multicultural and highly unequal. While engineering activities bring benefits, contributing to a more prosperous and equitable world, they may lead to potentially adverse consequences. Because the reality of each society is different from all others, it is not possible to define a one-size-fits-all approach to engineering education regarding ethical practices and sustainable development. It is, therefore, necessary to devise a conciliatory vision towards an environmentally ethical engineering practice that, at the same time, protects the environment while enabling all humans to leave with a minimum of dignity. This paper aims to raise awareness of the challenges facing humanity in the coming years, the role engineers must play in confronting them, and the paths they need to explore to find the right solutions. It is our responsibility to train young engineering students to be up to those challenges.},

  abstract={Entrepreneurship education has become increasingly relevant for societies. Consequently, Higher Education institutions constantly review their teaching methods to offer better and more innovative programs in this area. Challengebased learning helps students develop competencies while working on real projects and collaborating with different actors from the industry and academy. This study proposes the development of entrepreneurial competencies of students enrolled in a course designed around an international Challenge-based Learning between two institutions in Spain and Mexico. The experience has been developed through an online learning format with a real challenge delivered by an academic partner who was involved and interacted with students online and face-to-face in the two different locations. The goal for students was to learn, use, and apply data analytics through machine learning and to create an innovative solution around the challenge. Pre- and post-surveys were conducted to analyze the students' perceptions and performance in the learning experience. Results and findings show the students' perception regarding the development of learning through the challenge experience and the engrossment of the training partner regarding entrepreneurship and innovation competencies, multiculturalism, and the use of technologies to resolve the challenge. This work contribution shows the relevance of the Global Challenge-based Learning framework and its impact on collaborating with different disciplines and being open to diversity, especially when developing solutions for real problems. This work highlights the importance of practical teaching methods in entrepreneurship and the relevance of working in multidisciplinary and multicultural environments.},

  abstract={Social media has proven to be a game- changer in providing avenues for individuals from diverse back- grounds to communicate, exchange ideas, and enable friendships and businesses to reach new heights. Despite these profound advantages, it also has its downsides, especially when exposing users to fake news. The most worrisome aspect is when users react to such information using hate speech. Recent research has shown that fake news generates the most hate speech, as it evokes primordial sentiments of othering, dehumanization, and tribalism in multicultural societies. The study aims to compare the characteristics and behaviours of users engaged with hateful responses and those not engaged in hateful responses in code- mixed Nigerian English (broken) and English over events from 153 fake news posts from the political sphere in the Nigerian Election of 2023. The list of debunked fake stories was gathered from fact-checking websites, and the social media users who propagated these stories were identified. A corpus of 18,000 tweet replies was curated together with user profile information. A subset of 129 random hate speech and control non-hate speech user profiles was selected for this study. The main aim of the study was to investigate the unique characteristics of hate speech respondents and non-hate speech respondents by examining their profile descriptions. Hate users tend to have more followers, and engagement metrics than non- hate users even though they are not as active as non-hate users. Hate speech users had more blue verifications and location details on their profiles, but non- hate speech users’ locations had more identifiable real-world locations. The novel findings provide deeper insights into the characteristics of hate users, which can be used to develop features that will improve moderation and detection by machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract={Research in adult multicultural education is sparse. Andragogy (by Knowles) describes the Art and Science of teaching adults. When teaching, educators have to take the adult as an experienced, self-directed and task oriented individual into consideration and be culturally intelligent. In addition, contemporary education in the technology field requires an approach, which is interactive, task oriented and focused on solving real-life problems. Educators, at RIMC/IMTC, at the U.S. Consulate General Frankfurt, are faced with challenges like, multiculturalism, understanding adult education, and teaching IT concepts to these populations. As a work-related project, the investigator conducted the aforementioned research at RIMC/IMTC located at the U.S. Consulate General, Frankfurt. Current research is concerned with whether Andragogy can be applied to adults from different cultural backgrounds at IMTC Frankfurt. Specifically, the intent of the investigation is to determinewhether cultural factors have an impact on adults learning IT concepts at IMTC Frankfurt.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a large scale unlabeled person re-identification (Re-ID) dataset "LUPerson" and make the first attempt of performing unsupervised pre-training for improving the generalization ability of the learned person Re-ID feature representation. This is to address the problem that all existing person Re-ID datasets are all of limited scale due to the costly effort required for data annotation. Previous research tries to leverage models pre-trained on ImageNet to mitigate the shortage of person Re-ID data but suffers from the large domain gap between ImageNet and person Re-ID data. LUPerson is an unlabeled dataset of 4M images of over 200K identities, which is 30× larger than the largest existing Re-ID dataset. It also covers a much diverse range of capturing environments (e.g., camera settings, scenes, etc.). Based on this dataset, we systematically study the key factors for learning Re-ID features from two perspectives: data augmentation and contrastive loss. Unsupervised pre-training performed on this large-scale dataset effectively leads to a generic Re-ID feature that can benefit all existing person Re-ID methods. Using our pre-trained model in some basic frameworks, our methods achieve state-of-the-art results without bells and whistles on four widely used Re-ID datasets: CUHK03, Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17. Our results also show that the performance improvement is more significant on small-scale target datasets or under few-shot setting.},

  abstract={Three-dimensional Morphable Models (3DMMs) are powerful statistical tools for representing the 3D surfaces of an object class. In this context, we identify an interesting question that has previously not received research attention: is it possible to combine two or more 3DMMs that (a) are built using different templates that perhaps only partly overlap, (b) have different representation capabilities and (c) are built from different datasets that may not be publicly-available? In answering this question, we make two contributions. First, we propose two methods for solving this problem: i. use a regressor to complete missing parts of one model using the other, ii. use the Gaussian Process framework to blend covariance matrices from multiple models. Second, as an example application of our approach, we build a new head and face model that combines the variability and facial detail of the LSFM with the full head modelling of the LYHM. The resulting combined model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing head models by a large margin. Finally, as an application experiment, we reconstruct full head representations from single, unconstrained images by utilizing our proposed large-scale model in conjunction with the Face-Warehouse blendshapes for handling expressions.},

  title={On the Relationship Between the Developer’s Perceptible Race and Ethnicity and the Evaluation of Contributions in OSS}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={48},
  number={8},
  pages={2955-2968},
  abstract={Context: Open Source Software (OSS) projects are typically the result of collective efforts performed by developers with different backgrounds. Although the quality of developers’ contributions should be the only factor influencing the evaluation of the contributions to OSS projects, recent studies have shown that diversity issues are correlated with the acceptance or rejection of developers’ contributions. Objective: This paper assists this emerging state-of-the-art body on diversity research with the first empirical study that analyzes how developers’ perceptible race and ethnicity relates to the evaluation of the contributions in OSS. We also want to create awareness of the racial and ethnic diversity in OSS projects. Methodology: We performed a large-scale quantitative study of OSS projects in GitHub. We extracted the developers’ perceptible race and ethnicity from their names in GitHub using the Name-Prism tool and applied regression modeling of contributions (i.e, pull requests) data from GHTorrent and GitHub. Results: We observed that (1) among the developers whose perceptible race and ethnicity was captured by the tool, only 16.56 percent were perceptible as Non-White developers; (2) contributions from perceptible White developers have about 6–10 percent higher odds of being accepted when compared to contributions from perceptible Non-White developers; and (3) submitters with perceptible non-white races and ethnicities are more likely to get their pull requests accepted when the integrator is estimated to be from their same race and ethnicity rather than when the integrator is estimated to be White. Conclusion: Our initial analysis shows a low number of Non-White developers participating in OSS. Furthermore, the results from our regression analysis lead us to believe that there may exist differences between the evaluation of the contributions from different perceptible races and ethnicities. Thus, our findings reinforce the need for further studies on racial and ethnic diversity in software engineering to foster healthier OSS communities.},

  abstract={We sought to determine the level of maturity of the Cyberbullying research community and identify knowledge gaps that could be addressed in future projects in this area. Our findings suggest that the vast majority of academic contributions on cyberbullying focus on understanding the phenomenon, risk factors, and threats, with the prospect of suggesting possible protection strategies. The review calls for more research tackling the problem by leveraging statistical models and computational mechanisms geared to detect, intervene, and prevent cyberbullying. We argue that a multidisciplinary approach is needed for current challenges to be addressed and significant progress to be made, in order to combat this social menace.},

  abstract={Taking daily breakfast with healthy food is highly important for children to provide their body with indispensable nutritional elements after a lengthy rest. Skipping the morning breakfast, makes the majority of them feel tired and unfocused in the classroom. In addition, eating junk food may result in regression in children performance and generate important diseases like overweight or teeth decay. Several initiatives have been proposed to incite children to take their daily breakfast before going to school. However, we still need more efficient and attractive approaches to motivate the children eat healthily. In this research, we propose a virtual reality immersive system that allows the children to prepare their breakfast through direct interaction with food items. They can move into the virtual environment and select the food they like and receive immediate feedback about them. This approach enhanced the learning skills of children and kept them engaged for a longer time. An animated multimedia based tutorial is presented first to the children within a family setting to teach them about the importance of daily breakfast and the available items. They are then asked to use the virtual reality system to select healthy elements for their breakfast using a handy controller. They can see the items in an immersive environment and hold them virtually and place them on their plates. We compare the proposed VR approach with the traditional approaches of teaching. A group of 29 school children of 7-9 years old have been assessed using the different approaches. Our findings show clearly that the VR approach is a promising approach to learn. The children enjoyed learning through the VR and become more engaged as they interacted directly with the food items in a fully immersive environment.},

  abstract={Social media provides access to diverse and potentially conflicting information about organizations to potential job candidates. However, little is known about the impact of conflicting information between social media and corporate websites for recruitment and attraction. Using an experimental design, we exposed participants to a fictitious company website promoting an employer brand of diversity. Participants were then randomly shown a fictitious Linked In employee search result page depicting high-or low-employee diversity. Using the instrumental-symbolic framework and warranting theory, we posit that consistent information from Linked In will result in more positive image perceptions of organizations, ultimately leading to higher organizational attraction. Results show that participants who were exposed to information consistent with the organizational website promoting diversity rated that organization higher in agreeableness, and perceived agreeableness fully mediated the relationship between the experimental condition and organizational attractiveness.},

  abstract={This study examines the nature of issue-based Twitter response networks using the hashtag "#illridewithyou. This hashtag was a response of solidarity towards Muslims in Australia after a hostage incident that occurred in Sydney in December 2014. A network of 11293 users that used the hashtag #illridewithyou and their tweets were analyzed to examine the nature of engagement at network, ego, and semantic levels. Results show that although the #illridewithyou network has some characteristics of scale free networks, including a high clustering coefficient, low mean geodesic distance, and degree distribution approximating the power law, it lacks a giant connected component, but rather is structured into local clusters. Citizen participation, as indicated by out-degree, was considerably high in the network, and the topics discussed in the Tweets ranged from religion and empathy to globalism, multiculturalism and peace. Participants are globally connected but active in small clusters.},

  abstract={This research investigates the effect of IT-related financial innovation on banks' risk-taking based on the patent applications of the 100 largest U.S. Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) from 2005 until 2015. The results show that financial innovation within the research period is not only product-focused and in contrast mainly determined by IT-related innovations like risk management systems, credit scoring models and risk or pricing algorithms. The present empirical analysis furthermore addresses the simultaneous causality between innovation and risk-taking, which causes an endogeneity problem in the regression analysis. Two potential instrumental variables for innovation have been examined, which focus on the open-mindedness of the banks' headquarter environments in terms of racial and ethnic diversity and sexual orientation. The results underline the positive effects of an open-minded environment on the innovativeness of the financial industry. Innovation, synthesized by the instrumental variable Ssex, tends to decrease bank risk-taking.},

  abstract={Facial recognition systems have made significant strides thanks to data-heavy deep learning models, but these models rely on large privacy-sensitive datasets. Further, many of these datasets lack diversity in terms of ethnicity and demographics, which can lead to biased models that can have serious societal and security implications. To address these issues, we propose a methodology that leverages the biased generative model StyleGAN2 to create demographically diverse images of synthetic individuals. The synthetic dataset is created using a novel evolutionary search algorithm that targets specific demographic groups. By training face recognition models with the resulting balanced dataset containing 50,000 identities per race (13.5 million images in total), we can improve their performance and minimize biases that might have been present in a model trained on a real dataset.},

The main goal of EPS@ISEP is to offer a project-based educational experience to develop teamwork, communication, interpersonal and problem-solving skills in an international and multidisciplinary set up. The Sail Car team consisted of six Erasmus students, who participated in EPS@ISEP during the spring of 2019. The objective of the project was to design and develop a wind-powered, easy to drive land sailing vehicle. First, the team researched existing commercial solutions and considered the marketing, ethics and sustainability dimensions of the project. Next, based on these studies, specified the full set of requirements, designed the Sailo solution and procured the components and materials required to build a real size proof-of-concept prototype. Finally, the team assembled and tested successfully the prototype. At the end of the semester, the team considered EPS@ISEP a mind-opening opportunity.},

  pages={68-78},
  abstract={Context. Software professionals learned from their experience during the pandemic that most of their work can be done remotely, and now software companies are expected to adopt hybrid work models to avoid the resignation of talented professionals who require more flexibility and work-life balance. However, hybrid work is a spectrum of flexible work arrangements, and currently, there are no well-established hybrid work configurations to be followed in the post-pandemic period. Goal. We investigated how software engineers are experiencing the post-pandemic hybrid work landscape, aiming to understand the factors that influence their choices between remote and in-office work. Method. We explored a large South American company by collecting quantitative and qualitative data from 545 software professionals who are currently navigating diverse hybrid work arrangements tailored to their individual and team requirements. Findings. Our study revealed an array of factors that significantly impact hybrid work within the software industry, including individual preferences, work-life balance, commute time, social interactions, productivity, and more. Team dynamics, project demands, client expectations, and organizational strategies also play an important role in shaping the complex landscape of hybrid work configurations in software engineering. Conclusions. In summary, the success of hybrid work models depends on balancing individual preferences, team dynamics, and organizational strategies. Our study demonstrated that, at present, there is no one-size-fits-all individuals approach to hybrid work in the software industry.

  abstract={Providing feedback to learners on their writing assignments is one of the most important and time-consuming tasks that a supervisor performs. In e-Education environments, especially in the case of distance learning, giving feedback becomes more challenging because there are often no opportunities for face-to-face interaction. Typically, a supervisor provides comments to learners in written form via email; however, the use of recorded audio feedback (RAF) in e-Education environments has become a viable alternative. This work in progress reports on learners' perceptions of RAF in a multi-cultural higher e-Education context. Our observations indicate that learners tend to have positive feelings toward RAF and that RAF potentially moderates cultural effects. The observations are discussed in light of the relevant literature, and future research questions are proposed.},

  abstract={The EuroMPM [1] is a pan-European cooperation on Master education in project management with seven well aligned Master programmes in different European countries dealing with the ambition to offer an academic education in project management on EQF level 7 [2]. Connecting several Master programmes in a cross-border virtual Master School is a straightforward approach for high-quality Master education - especially in domains with a high level of transdisciplinary, international cooperation (e.g. the KIC Master Schools [3], or the MSPME [4]). The EuroMPM uses the concept of the cross-border Master School to address some typical competence requirements for international project managers: intercultural teamwork & communication, interdisciplinary & international cooperation, diversity in topics and tailored approaches (driven by innovations, technology development and new business models, e.g. the digital transformation) and project complexity. The EuroMPM Master School goes beyond traditional exchange semesters. Important elements are block-oriented teaching in workshops with students and lecturers from partner universities, with industry involvement [5] and with an interdisciplinary teamwork. Exchange is fostered by a high number of interaction points between the programmes, e.g. summer schools and student conferences. Furthermore, the concept of the international classroom contributes to a unique learning experience. A virtual cross-border Master School on a European scale as the EuroMPM has the required international project culture already in its own DNA. EuroMPM conducts the research on the efficiency and effectivity of the competence delivery based on a tailored indicator framework. We will present the EuroMPM concept, excerpts of the indicator framework and examples of measurement results.},

  abstract={Workforce diversity has grown into an imperative problem throughout the world as it is deeply connected to organizational performance. This indicates that the organization should be enhanced and competitive in the current global environment. To enter the international arena, workforce diversity is among fundamental solutions. The organization must utilize or spend essential reserves on workforce diversity to generate chances for optimum employee productivity. Various workforce diversity factors influence employee productivity, thus influencing the organizational performance and the built environment. This research aims to analyze the location, physical ability, ethnicity, and labor union related workforce diversity factors influencing labor productivity. Data was collected through on-site surveys by getting survey questionnaire filled by 131 management professionals employed at different project sites. Based on average MIR values, location and physical ability factors were characterized as most critical among the workforce diversity factors affecting the labor productivity. Also, it was identified that the labor productivity is highly reliant on the location of the workplace, the environment provided, the physical ability of a worker, cultural norms and lockdown effects particularly. This research involves the participants from the construction industry of Pakistan; the potential research can be extended to further service sectors and growing economies.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been extensive research on student housing with the most debatable research topic focusing on student's residential satisfaction. However, there is still a dearth of research trying to understand how students perceive the performance of service quality in student housing and how students translate their perceptions into behavioural intentions. Thus, this study has investigated service quality performance as the main factors to influence the students' behavioural intentions. Paper-and-pencil questionnaires were distributed face-to-face to 1526 students in seven Malaysian public and private universities and 1184 useful responses were received. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and covariance-based structural equation modelling. The results revealed that the aesthetic, freedom, serenity, and management dimensions significantly influenced the slightly likely execution of favourable behavioural intentions. The results imply that when students are adaptable to living in a multi-cultural community, have personal privacy, receive good hospitality, and perceive suitable building ambiance, they will show positive behaviour towards their student housing.},

  abstract={This study investigates the cultural dependence of a facial expression recognition (FER) system in an interactive agent by analyzing the performance of several recognition models in different cultural domains. A comprehensive cross-domain classification performance assessment reveals disparities in model performance across different cultural contexts, indicating challenges in cross-cultural FER. To further investigate these characteristics, several public datasets across regions and our cross-cultural dataset of facial expressions derived from Thai and Japanese TV shows are analyzed. By evaluating the capacity of existing FER models to interpret our newly collected data, we found significant variations in emotion interpretation across these cultural contexts, highlighting the necessity for culturally inclusive algorithms. These findings underscore the critical need for more consideration of cultural diversity in FER research, marking a crucial step toward more inclusive and culturally sensitive artificial intelligence technologies.},

Data collection was conducted through semi-structured interviews (n=25), which we analyzed using a two-pronged approach: 1) through attribute coding, we identified demographic information, and 2) through value coding, we identified the participant motivations for mentoring, which enabled us to identify the value attributed to the mentoring experience and thus each participant's rationale for participating in the mentoring experiences. The themes that emerged from this analysis were mentors valuing their roles as influencers for the younger generation, mentors' enjoyment in teaching and sharing their interest in science, and the belief that their roles in the camp enhanced their professional opportunities. The results of this study contribute to the literature on mentor motivation and provide empirical evidence for educators and administrators who aim to incentivize mentor engagement.},

While signing avatar technology research has focused on legibility and appearance, there has been little attention paid to representing diversity in signing avatars, and the default is often a white female animation. We present data from focus groups conducted in two ongoing sign language machine translation projects in Europe that give insight into deaf end-users’ desires for diversity in avatar representations. Our results reveal a strong desire for full customisability, including options for representing diversity in gender expression and ethnicity, as well as accommodating sociolinguistic variation and personal identity through modified avatar signing styles. This work provides initial insights, but considerable future research is necessary, particularly with minorities and sub-groups within deaf communities.},

  abstract={Globalization is one of the long-term trends worldwide, referring to the interconnectedness and interdependence of economies, cultures, societies, and technologies on a global scale. Education is not a separate part of society; so, it is prone to changes due to globalization as well. We can see it in growing preference of the use of English, in multilingual characteristics of schools, etc. The driving forces behind globalization include advancements in communication, transportation, and technology, as well as liberalization and a variety of integration policies. An intriguing question arises regarding cultural unification: does globalization lead to the homogenization of cultures? Conversely, nationalism presents itself as an opposing phenomenon to globalization and is also a visible trend today. Nationalism emphasizes the significance of national identity and culture, seeking to preserve a nation’s unique characteristics and promote its interests. While nationalism can be viewed positively to uphold traditional values within society, it can also be perceived negatively when utilized to serve political agendas. How does globalization manifest in education? This paper initiates a discussion on the topic by first examining globalization as a phenomenon and the role of national culture in it and then delving into selected topics in the area.},

  abstract={In this Research Full Paper we explore the factors that traditionally minoritized students consider when selecting a graduate school to pursue a doctoral degree in an engineering discipline. To this end, we used case study methods to analyze the experiences of ten traditionally minoritized students through interviews conducted immediately after they had selected their graduate programs, but before they had commenced their studies. Our findings show that in choosing an institution, the most salient ideals these students hold are related to the offer of funding towards their degree and an alignment with their initial research interests. However, they described having made compromises on ideals related to their personal experience and racial identity, the most prominent being finding a faculty mentor with a similar racial background, finding a racially diverse institution, or being located in a geographical location they perceived to be more amenable to their individual identities. These findings suggest that continuing to increase the recruitment of traditionally minoritized faculty in engineering schools would have a direct impact on minoritized student recruitment, by thus helping to create spaces where more of their racial identity ideals are met and fewer compromises are made. Equally important to the recruitment of traditionally minoritized students is the transparency of funding opportunities during the recruitment and application processes, and the publication of current research opportunities within the institution.},

The students in the course came from multi-cultural, multi-national, and multi-ethnic backgrounds. Preliminary results indicate that all students use an online site and the OERs to collaborate on group assignments and to build relationships with their peers. In addition, most of the international students spent extra time reviewing the OERs and other materials placed online to prepare for in-class discussions and exams. As the higher education landscape continues to tilt towards a global, open-sourced, and inter-connected learning environment, the use of OERs will allow faculty members to help students enhance learning experiences, build strong connections with their peers, and gain greater appreciation of diverse cultures and diverse viewpoints, while in college.},

  pages={2336-2344},
  abstract={Data networks are typically equipped with the same hardware and software stacks. Correlated attacks exploiting shared vulnerabilities at the nodes may result in massive failures that disrupt network operation. In this paper, multiple correlated failures that may negatively impact a monoculture network are analyzed and a methodology to reduce their effects is proposed. The proposed methodology consists of introducing diversity into the network components by optimally selecting both the number of different network nodes and their locations within the network. First, an algorithm is proposed to introduce node diversity in the topology considering nodes' vulnerability indexes, which are associated with node vendors. Next, two different optimal node placement algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm aims to cluster nodes of the same type to maintain network connectivity, while the second seeks to maximize the network centrality metric to identify key nodes in the network. Our results show that reliability can increase up to 50% when compared to a monoculture design.},

  title={Towards Inclusive Educational AI: Auditing Frontier LLMs for Cultural Biases through a Multiplexity Lens}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-10},
  abstract={As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Llama 3 become integral to educational contexts, concerns are mounting over the cultural biases, power imbalances, and ethical limitations embedded within these technologies. Though generative AI tools aim to enhance learning experiences, they often reflect values rooted in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) cultural paradigms, potentially sidelining diverse global perspectives. This paper proposes a framework to assess and mitigate cultural bias within LLMs through applied multiplexity. Multiplexity, inspired by Senturk et al. and rooted in Islamic and other wisdom traditions, emphasizes the coexistence of diverse cultural viewpoints, supporting a multilayered epistemology that integrates empirical sciences and normative values. Our analysis reveals that LLMs frequently exhibit cultural polarization in both overt responses and subtle contextual cues. To address these biases, we propose two strategies: Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, which embed multiplex principles directly into the system prompt, and Multi-Agent System (MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents representing distinct cultural viewpoints collaboratively generate balanced responses. Our findings demonstrate that as mitigation strategies evolve from contextual prompting to MAS-implementation, cultural inclusivity markedly improves, evidenced by a significant rise in the Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS) and a PDS Entropy increase from 3.25% at baseline to 98% with the MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs. Sentiment analysis shows a shift towards positive sentiment across cultures, with the MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs achieving 0% negative sentiment. This study establishes a baseline for assessing and fostering cultural inclusivity in educational AI, laying the groundwork for a globally pluralistic approach that respects diverse cultural perspectives.},

  abstract={The internet and web services continue to grow rapidly and so does the needs of users. Users prefer easy and fast services that can be accessed everywhere such as paying utility bills and scheduling appointments. In doing so, on-line services need to be provided by governments to facilitate easy access. In this age of globalization, we live in a highly diversified world in which people from different cultural backgrounds live together. Users interactions become more appealing if cultural characteristics are incorporated into the interface design. Culture could have an important impact upon people using the web services. Thus, designing web services for a multi-cultural society will require studying in depth the effect of the society cultural characteristics. The user interface can be designed using those characteristics that help in gaining user's attention. This paper investigates the influence of culture on the user interface design of Bahrain e-Government services to examine the views of cultural effect on the user interface design. The results also show the positive and negative impact of users' culture on the interface design.},

  year={2024},
  volume={5},

  pages={406-417},
  abstract={Detecting facial expressions is a challenging task in the field of computer vision. Several datasets and algorithms have been proposed over the past two decades; however, deploying them in real-world, in-the-wild scenarios hampers the overall performance. This is because the training data does not completely represent socio-cultural and ethnic diversity; the majority of the datasets consist of American and Caucasian populations. On the contrary, in a diverse and heterogeneous population distribution like the Indian subcontinent, the need for a significantly large enough dataset representing all the ethnic groups is even more critical. To address this, we present InFER++, an India-specific, multi-ethnic, real-world, in-the-wild facial expression dataset consisting of seven basic expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest India-specific facial expression dataset. Our cross-dataset analysis of RAF-DB vs InFER++ shows that models trained on RAF-DB were not generalizable to ethnic datasets like InFER++. This is because the facial expressions change with respect to ethnic and socio-cultural factors. We also present LiteXpressionNet, a lightweight deep facial expression network that outperforms many existing lightweight models with considerably fewer FLOPs and parameters. The proposed model is inspired by MobileViTv2 architecture, which utilizes GhostNetv2 blocks to increase parametrization while reducing latency and FLOP requirements. The model is trained with a novel objective function that combines early learning regularization and symmetric cross-entropy loss to mitigate human uncertainties and annotation bias in most real-world facial expression datasets.},

  abstract={As a fast-growing metropolitan, Jakarta is exposed by global flows consisting of ethnoscapes, mediascapes, technoscapes, financescapes, ideoscapes, and linguascapes. The flows increase diversity due to human contact across cultural boundaries that add complexity to Jakarta's society. Concerning the English language and culture classroom in Jakarta, the learners contribute to the diversity and bring in varieties of English language and culture. The learners are predominantly digital natives who earn English from games, media, and technology. On one hand, diversity becomes a competitive edge, though on the other hand diversity is the source of social capital in English language and culture classrooms in Jakarta. Giving room for the varieties is aligned with cosmopolitan pedagogy which allows dialogue of local diversities to ensure global community membership which is dominated by the global virtual community. The pedagogy has been put forward as a pathway towards intercultural communicative competence. Therefore, this study is interested to explore the trace of cosmopolitan pedagogy in the selected English classroom in Jakarta, Indonesia. Furthermore, this study shall reveal the reification of cosmopolitan pedagogy within the syllabus, teaching materials, language policies, and classroom practices. The result of this study shall put forward the pedagogy to nurture the digital native learners in Jakarta, Indonesia, to prepare the learners in virtual community which will dominate society 5.0.},

  abstract={This study introduces a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and processing cultural knowledge, with a specific focus on Hakka culture as a case study. Leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy, the study develops a multi-dimensional framework that systematically assesses LLMs across six cog-nitive domains: Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating. This benchmark ex-tends beyond traditional single-dimensional evaluations by providing a deeper analysis of LLMs' abilities to handle cul-turally specific content, ranging from basic recall of facts to higher-order cognitive tasks such as creative synthesis. Ad-ditionally, the study integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to address the challenges of minority cultural knowledge representation in LLMs, demonstrating how RAG enhances the models' performance by dynamically incorporating relevant external information. The results high-light the effectiveness of RAG in improving accuracy across all cognitive domains, particularly in tasks requiring precise retrieval and application of cultural know ledge. However, the findings also reveal the limitations of RAG in creative tasks, underscoring the need for further optimization. This benchmark provides a robust tool for evaluating and com-paring LLMs in culturally diverse contexts, offering valuable insights for future research and development in AI -driven cultural knowledge preservation and dissemination.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving landscape of engineering education, upskilling and lifelong learning have become critical to maintaining competitiveness and fostering innovation. The use of ontologies, such as the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO), plays a crucial role in organizing and managing the skills required for modern engineering roles. However, the slow pace of ontology updates and the lack of contextual adaptability present significant challenges, leading to outdated and irrelevant information for educators, learners, and industry professionals. This paper explores the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge engineering to accelerate the process of updating ontologies like ESCO. By dynamically analyzing data and incor-porating contextual information, LLMs offer promising avenues for enhancing the evolution and precision of these ontologies. We discuss the potential impact of this approach in engineering education, particularly in aligning ups killing and reskilling efforts with the demands of emerging technologies such as AI -driven automation and digital engineering. This paper aims to highlight how LLMs can support the creation of more responsive, context-aware learning frameworks, ultimately sustaining educational ex-cellence and fostering critical thinking in engineering education.},

  abstract={Immigration and integration of foreign communities is a condition that strongly affects the form and the meaning of public space. In contexts that are new to the phenomenon, there may be an occasion to revise the protocols and models for the development of new spatial relationships, based on the presence of communities that are no longer homogeneous. The theme of urban regeneration due to the presence of migrant communities has been addressed in various ways and from different points of view, often focusing on the creation of urban spaces capable of improving livability, rarely with the creation of integration processes or the construction of new urban identities. However, a resilient point of view, in ecological and social terms, can allow a new perspective on the way in which the multiple presence of communities that are no longer “original” has radically changed the sense of urban space. This contribution reports some experimental experiences on how the city and the community in progress can develop a coordinated system of actions able to act on the theme of reception and integration, working in the perspective of urban resilience and acting on social policies and on the spatial relevance of integration programs. Through cooperative learning, in a process of applied research with experts in the social habit of four Sicilian cities (Ragusa, Catania, Caltanissetta, and Palermo) the tested integration policies will be evaluated not in terms of melting pot, but in terms of identifying identity spaces able to build a sense of community.},

  abstract={Face recognition systems have made significant strides thanks to data-heavy deep learning models, but these models rely on large privacy-sensitive datasets. Recent work in facial analysis and recognition have thus started making use of synthetic datasets generated from GANs and diffusion based generative models. These models, however, lack fairness in terms of demographic representation and can introduce the same biases in the trained downstream tasks. This can have serious societal and security implications. To address this issue, we propose a methodology that generates unbiased data from a biased generative model using an evolutionary algorithm. We show results for StyleGAN2 model trained on the Flicker Faces High Quality dataset to generate data for singular and combinations of demographic attributes such as Black and Woman. We generate a large racially balanced dataset of 13.5 million images, and show that it boosts the performance of facial recognition and analysis systems whilst reducing their biases. We have made our code-base (https://github.com/anubhav1997/youneednodataset) public to allow researchers to reproduce our work.},

  abstract={Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy has emerged in recent years as a fundamental theoretical approach to incorporating children's different languages, cultures, and identities into the teaching process, leading to the consolidation of the concept of Intercultural Education. On the other hand, social robotics has recently shown its potential applications both as a powerful tool in the educational sector, to help children learn a second language or to deal with children's special needs, also being an instrument for inclusion. This paper introduces the project SONRIE, which has the primary goal of defining a software framework for social robots able to operate in kindergartens and primary schools with children of different cultures. The presented work represents the initial phase of this project, aimed at analyzing some of the technical and scientific issues that may arise when deploying a social robot in such contexts, also proposing possible solutions to these challenges.},

  year={2024},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This work-in-progress innovative paper outlines the development of a recently adopted policy on multilingualism and multiculturalism to enhance global competence in engineering education within one of the first European University Alliances (EUA), comprising nine universities from nine European Union countries. The policy represents a creative and ambitious response to not only the call to embed such competencies in curricula but also to invite all stakeholders in the alliance to become agents of change in order to leverage existing linguistic and cultural assets in all their work. In terms of content, the policy builds on and extends a rich foundation of established scholarship on the development of intercultural, plurilingual, and global competence in engineering education and fills a gap in current educational practice by operationalizing these concepts in the context of a EUA. Applying complex systems theory, the paper describes how the policy's development, endorsement, and planned implementation reveal the complex interactions among multiple stakeholders within the EUA's organizational ecosystem and its constituent institutions. By highlighting the policy's potential to catalyze adaptive change and foster resilience within the system, as well as to inspire actors outside the Alliance, the policy not only addresses immediate educational needs but also anticipates the challenges of engineering education and practice in a world characterized by cultural and linguistic diversity, and confronts a reality in which such diversity is not universally celebrated as a beneficial resource, despite the European Union's motto of “united in diversity.” The policy is further supported by an innovative guide for implementation, offering practical activities for individual growth, collaborative engagement, and community enhancement, embodying the policy's comprehensive approach to fostering global competence through multilingualism and multiculturalism. While the content of the policy is well aligned with the explicit goals of the Alliance and the broader European Union project ethos of which the EUAs are a part, the policy is deliberately general in its description of its agenda to allow for flexibility in responding to the different local contexts, challenges, resources, and priorities of the Alliance's partner universities, none of which have a policy as ambitious as that of the Alliance. While the policy is closely linked to and must be seen in the context of the emergence and partly unpredictable future development of the Alliance, the built-in non-linearity of its implementation makes it vulnerable to factors at play within the Alliance that could effectively nullify the implementation of the policy or reinforce negative feedback loops that serve to maintain the status quo at partner universities. While the trajectory of the policy demonstrates the importance of initiatives at both the individual and group levels, the realization of the policy and its prescribed practices ultimately depends on political decisions within the Alliance and within the educational leadership of the European Union, where an agreed vision for the future of EUAs has yet to crystallize.},

  abstract={This study explores the efficacy of AI-generated music compared to traditional pop music in alleviating anxiety among high school students from a Chinese international school and an American high school. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the research integrates quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to assess the impacts of music interventions before and after exposure. Initial findings indicated that both groups experienced significant reductions in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7 scale, with AI-generated music showing a greater decrease. The quantitative results revealed that after a four-week intervention, students listening to AI music exhibited a marked improvement in anxiety levels with the Chinese international school students' scores dropping from an average of 13.33 to 6.06, and the American students' scores from 14.02 to 7.28. In contrast, those who listened to pop music also showed improvements but to a lesser extent. Qualitative interviews further highlighted the personalized experience of AI music, enhancing its effectiveness in reducing stress compared to the broader appeal of pop music which was linked more to cultural resonance and social connectivity. The interaction effects analyzed through mixed linear models and F-tests showed statistically significant differences in the impact of music types across cultures. This study underscores the potential of personalized AI-driven music interventions in mental health strategies tailored for diverse cultural contexts, suggesting a paradigm shift towards more customized therapeutic approaches in global mental health education.},

  abstract={Complex adaptive systems such as economies, ecosystems, or organizations require diversity to thrive and survive. Within a business, diversity can create greater robustness, allowing better adaptation and flexibility in response to the external environment, and a provides a driver for novelty and change. This paper examines how ethnic and gender diversity in leadership contributes to sustainability performance in FTSE 100 organizations, measured using the Environmental-Social-Governance (ESG) risk score. Such a contribution has been difficult to demonstrate in the past and evidence suggests no linear relationship. This paper uses functional clustering, a novel analytics method from the field of ecology, to show that greater ethnic and gender diversity leads directly to better sustainability performance in FTSE 100 companies. The results show clear benefits from gender diversity to sustainability performance and practices. Conclusions, limitations and implications for research and practice are noted.},

This project was based on the convergence of the theory of Community of Inquiry (CoI), International Collaborative Online Learning (COIL), and the integration of Mixed Realities, Metaverse, and generative artificial intelligence. The central objective of this collaboration was to improve the technical and creative skills of students of architecture, industrial design, digital art, communication, and music production through a pedagogical approach that utilizes 3D spatial visualization and intercultural interaction. The use of the Tec Virtual Campus's Metaverse and the Global Classroom program was instrumental in facilitating real-time collaboration among students from different countries, allowing for the creation of joint projects that reflect a deep understanding of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This effort resulted in an advanced methodology that improves students' technical skills and promotes a meaningful global commitment to sustainability and social responsibility, reflecting the transformative power of international collaborative education.},

  abstract={Micro-inequities are subtle, repetitive, and often unintentional forms of negative messaging, that can account for a significant burden over time. Research shows that racial and gender minority groups are more likely to experience micro-inequities, and that micro-inequities have a significant negative effect on self-esteem, work performance and career advancement. However, research on micro-inequities among software practitioners, particularly with an immigration perspective, is non-existent. To bridge this gap, we investigate the experiences of software practitioners, regarding micro-inequities from an immigration perspective. We surveyed 135 immigrant and non-immigrant software practitioners working in technical roles about verbal, nonverbal and environmental micro-inequities. Our results show that immigrants experience nine out of 27 investigated forms of micro-inequities significantly more than non-immigrants. These include not being given credit for their work, feeling excluded from key social or networking opportunities and being assumed to be less competent, assertive or intelligent. Our study can serve as an incentive for practitioners to adopt (more) inclusive work practices and to raise awareness about micro-inequities in the community.Lay Abstract: Micro-inequities are subtle, repetitive, and often unintentional forms of negative messaging, that can account for a significant burden over time. While research shows that underrepresented groups are more likely to experience micro-inequities, they have not been extensively studied in the software industry. In our work we survey 135 software practitioners regarding their experiences with micro-inequities in the software industry from an immigration perspective. Our findings show that immigrants experience some forms of micro-inequities significantly more than non-immigrants.},

  abstract={In an increasingly volatile, globalized, and demanding market, Lean is the differential factor that could increase companies' competitiveness and efficiency. In spite of the abundant literature addressing Lean system's technical aspects, there has been little discussion on the importance of national culture in Lean's implementation process. It has been proven that the implementation of lean practices do not always produce the intended results and national culture has been highlighted as one of the contextual variables that may explain the success or failure of Lean practices. Since companies are influenced by the culture of the country where they're located, some comparative advantages may occur due to their location, making it necessary to adjust Lean's implementation process to national culture. The purpose of this article is to propose a literature review to examine the relationship between national culture and Lean Management. This study explores the assertions and/or contradictions found in the literature regarding the cultural dimensions that may act as enablers or withholders to the lean principles and practices.},

  abstract={Clear, impartial and engaging dissemination of engineering, technological and scientific endeavors is an important requirement for democratic societies. A massive amount of news and information is continuously available online - creating new challenges for journalists. We have developed a project-base bachelor course that introduces students to modern, professional technical journalism and advances their soft skills. Each student is required to create three features (i.e. two multimedia articles and one social media piece) that report on technology. Each created feature must contain an original multimedia component using state-of-the-art journalistic tools (e.g. videos, interactive graphics, animations). Those features that meet this requirement and fulfill journalistic standards are subsequently published online using a professional platform (i.e. WordPress). While writing in German is allowed, the use of English language is highly encouraged for crossing cultural boundaries and engaging the world-wide community. Students who are seeking a technical journalistic degree must also pass engineering courses. This concurrent technical journalism education is important for developing critical thinking and reporting. Furthermore the course increases gender-sensitivity in reporting, an important ongoing issue in a traditionally male dominated discipline.},

The traditional NSGA-II (Quick Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms-II) algorithm is improved, and the improved NSGA-II algorithm is obtained to solve the resource allocation problem. Music dance resource management system is designed, implemented and tested. Through simulation and verification, the improved NSGA-II algorithm has better performance in average service delay time and average stability of task execution under different tasks and different fog nodes. In functional testing, the overall situation of music dance resource management system is good, and the design requirements are basically met. In performance testing, the response time is short and the throughput is high. Therefore, the system has high performance, and can meet the large amount of concurrent data access, which makes the user have better experience.},

  abstract={Reaching marginal and other migrant communities to elicit their political views and opinions is a well-known challenge. Social media has enabled a certain amount of online activism and participation, especially in societies with abundant multicultural identities. However, it can be quite challenging to isolate the voice of the migrant in English-speaking countries, especially with an abundance of content in English on social media. In this paper, we pursue a case study of Ireland’s Twitter landscape, specifically migrant and native activists. We present a methodology that can accurately ( $>80\%$ ) isolate the Irish migrant voice with as little as 25 English tweets without relying on user metadata and using simple, highly explainable, out-of-the-box machine learning methods. Using this, we distil (via sentiment analysis) polarities of views, segment (via BERT-based topic modelling) and summarise (via ChatGPT) differentiated views in a consumable manner for policymakers. Our approach enables policymakers to further their understanding of multicultural communities and use this to inform their decision-making processes.},

  abstract={Learning brings students and educators from different backgrounds together, challenging cross-cultural communication. As the institution becomes increasingly diverse, understanding the concept of cultural intelligence and strategies for inclusion becomes imperative for providing an inclusive environment in learning. The holistic bibliometric approach of CCC combined with big data analytics (CCC-BA) represents the method used in this research to analyze the development of CI in educational literature. Inter-cultural communication evolvement was tracked, core themes were determined, and cross-cultural communication was assessed empirically on a sample basis of multicultural student teams. The current research studied the level at which instructors can communicate cross-culturally and explored how the analytic principle can enhance teaching. Results were significant, with the reference value being 89.7% when carrying out multivariate analysis of factors that influence intercultural communication competence using big data analytical methods. The findings highlighted areas where future research was urgently required, provided practical suggestions for teachers, and demonstrated that CI leads to less cultural misunderstanding and better collaboration. They also recommended incorporating intercultural communication training into school programs for students and teachers. These results evidence the potential of raising cultural awareness at school for improving learning and teamwork in multicultural classrooms, to ensure environments that value and understand diversity.},

  abstract={Multilingual Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) systems allow for the joint training of data-rich and data-scarce languages in a single model. This enables data and parameter sharing across languages, which is especially beneficial for the data-scarce languages. However, most state-of-the-art multilingual models require the encoding of language information and therefore are not as flexible or scalable when expanding to newer languages. Language-independent multilingual models help to address this issue, and are also better suited for multicultural societies where several languages are frequently used together (but often rendered with different writing systems). In this paper, we propose a new approach to building a language-agnostic multilingual ASR system which transforms all languages to one writing system through a many-to-one transliteration transducer. Thus, similar sounding acoustics are mapped to a single, canonical target sequence of graphemes, effectively separating the modeling and rendering problems. We show with four Indic languages, namely, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil and Kannada, that the language-agnostic multilingual model achieves up to 10% relative reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) over a language-dependent multilingual model.},

  abstract={With the increasing global emphasis on sustainability, it is crucial to explore strategies that enable industries to adopt environmentally friendly and resource-efficient manufacturing processes. The study specifically focuses on enhancing the competencies of professionals in additive manufacturing, a multidisciplinary field encompassing mechanical engineering, electronics, and computer science, to contribute to sustainable production practices. Problem-centered and guided expert interviews were conducted with 12 experts from diverse industries to accomplish this. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and Mayring's content analysis method was employed to evaluate the transcripts. This methodology identified vital competencies, including knowledge of technology and materials, part identification skills, and a comprehensive understanding of the AM process chain. The findings also highlighted the significance of soft or interpersonal skills, such as teamwork, effective communication, adapting to multicultural and diverse environments, and more. Furthermore, the interviews revealed opportunities for sustainability and emphasized the importance of increased collaboration among companies and universities involved in AM. The insights gained from this research will inform the development of training programs and guidelines to foster sustainable production in advanced manufacturing.},

  abstract={Virtual reality engages participants through immersive experiences of imaginary or real three-dimensional physical environments. The combination of globalization and technology is transforming the international economy, altering the demand for skills and knowledge required from today's university graduates. To improve students' skills we have developed in the last ten years the TalkTech project, as an open virtual mobility, a project based learning with the aim of creating a multimedia artefact. The 2017 study examines how students, working to create virtual reality artefacts, also develop digital skills and critical thinking. The paper also examines how participating in open virtual mobility project enables an online multicultural educational environment that changes the students' abilities to learn and acquire knowledge. In this collaborative study, students create virtual reality artefacts using CoSpaces, a web-based virtual reality development platform, share them with their international but also local partners, and discuss similarities and differences in their work. The findings indicate that by real-time mixing of different tools and online and mobile technologies and apps students' digital skills are improved.},

  abstract={Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a modern and powerful approach that has resulted in major improvements compared to traditional techniques of machine translation for translating one language into another. In the world, India is a very multicultural and multilingual country. People of India from various regions use their own regional communication languages, making India stand at the second position in the world to have maximum languages. In India, English is provided as the second extra official language. But the usage of English in India is very less forming a communication gap. To minimize this gap by translating one language into another language is almost impossible for humans. It can be achieved by a machine translation. This paper focuses on translating Indic languages using the translation technique of Neural technology. A Sequence to Sequence model with encoder-decoder attention mechanism of neural machine translation is proposed for Telugu language conversion into English and vice versa.},

  abstract={Machine Translation (MT) is very useful in supporting multicultural communication. Existing Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) which requires high quality and quantity of corpora and Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT) which requires bilingual dictionaries, morphological, syntax, and semantic analyzer are scarce for low-resource languages. Due to the lack of language resources, it is difficult to create MT from high-resource languages to low-resource languages like Indonesian ethnic languages. Nevertheless, Indonesian ethnic languages' characteristics motivate us to introduce a Pivot-Based Hybrid Machine Translation (PHMT) by combining SMT and RBMT with Indonesian as a pivot which we further utilize in a multilingual communication support system. We evaluate PHMT translation quality with fluency and adequacy as metrics and then evaluate usability of the system. Despite the medium average translation quality (3.05 fluency score and 3.06 adequacy score), the 3.71 average mean scores of the usability evaluation indicates that the system is useful to support multilingual collaboration.},

  abstract={Globally distributed Information and Communication Technology (ICT)projects, typically engage multistakeholders coming from diverse multicultural backgrounds, with varied interests and collaborating across remote geographical locations using different technologies. This is viewed as a significant challenge and of strategic importance in the face of stakeholder adversities. This paper builds on scientific findings in an integrated approach to analyse the stakeholder engagement in globally distributed ICT projects in line with underlying aspects of people, organisation and business environment. The interplays, adversities and strategies in engaging multistakeholders are explored and a research model is conceptualised to showcase the multifaceted constructs, related to people, organisation and business environment that can be combined to create numerous `Themes of Interplay' which can affect several stakeholder adversities and the relevant strategies needed to mitigate such stakeholder adversities. The research focal points are highlighted and an agenda for future research is proposed.},

  abstract={Indonesian IT engineers need to have both hard and soft skills to be ready in global market competition in term of work force. Hard skills are the technical expertise related to their field of work. On the other hand, soft skills are also the important part of the engineers' capability including communication, creativity, adaptability, collaboration and leadership. The purpose of this paper is to develop theoretical review of how to educate Indonesian IT engineers to be ready to face global job market competition by the use of cross-cultural training program in the university in Indonesia. This study reports the results of a web-based survey of Indonesian expatriate engineers addressing their knowledge, experience and perceptions of working in multicultural working environment in some engineering projects. The output of this paper is a framework of cross-cultural training as the supplementary material in the university curriculum in engineering education in Indonesia.},

  title={Perspectives of Global Engineering Leadership from Worldwide Faculty and Students}, 
  year={2018},

  abstract={Proficient leadership skills are increasingly crucial for engineers as they are expected to work in multi-disciplinary and multicultural teams across the world. However, perspectives of engineering leadership are ill-defined and may vary depending on the region, school or country of residence or work. While both industry and academia concur that leadership skills are crucial to engineering graduates, there is considerable controversy over the definition of `global engineering leadership'. This lack of consensus may hinder the future formation of globally-prepared engineering leaders. This work-in-progress paper describes an exploratory study to understand how `global engineering leadership' is perceived by engineering students and faculty across worldwide institutions (predominantly across African, European, North and South American countries). The study utilizes a semi-structured survey developed from literature on national and international engineering leadership and prior work on engineering professional identity. Data was collected from two populations, the first representing students registered in engineering across worldwide institutions and the second representing engineering faculty who have demonstrated interest in leadership at their institutions. The two populations will allow scholars to compare and contrast how these perspectives changed across the different groups with the goal of developing a working definition of `global engineering leadership'. This definition may serve as a starting point to develop recommendations and strategies for engineering educators wishing to introduce their students a globalized view of engineering leadership.},
