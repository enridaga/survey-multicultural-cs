abstract = {The ubiquity of smartphones and social media such as Twitter is clearly blurring traditional boundaries between producers and consumers of information. This is especially the case in emergency situations where people in the scene create and share on-the-spot information about the incident in real time. However, despite the proven importance of such platforms, finding event-related information from the real-time feeds of thousands of tweets is a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel method for detecting event-specific and informative tweets that are likely to be beneficial for emergency response. The method investigates a sample dataset of tweets which was collected during a storm event passing over a specific area. The sample is manually labelled by three emergency management experts who annotated the sample dataset to obtain the ground truth through identification of the event-related tweets. A selected number of representative event-related tweets are used to extract the common patterns and to define event related term-classes based on term frequency analysis. The term-classes are used to evaluate the event relatedness of a sample dataset through a relationship scoring process. Consequently, each sample tweet is given an event-relatedness score which indicates how related a tweet is to the storm event. The results are compared with the ground truth to determine the cut-off relatedness score and to evaluate the performance of the method. The results of the evaluation indicate that the proposed method is able to detect event-related tweets with about 87% accuracy in a timely manner.}

abstract = {Context: Security, in digitally connected organizational environments of today, involves many different perspectives, including social, physical, and technical factors. In order to understand the interactions among these correlated aspects and elicit potential threats geared towards a given organization, different security requirements analysis approaches are proposed in the literature. However, the body of knowledge is yet to unleash its full potential due to the complex nature of security problems, and inadequate ways to improve security awareness of key players in the organization. Objective: Objective(s) of the research study is to improve the security awareness of players utilizing serious games via: (i) Know-how of security concepts and security protection; (ii) guided process of identifying valuable assets and vulnerabilities in a given organizational setting; (iii) guided process of defining successful security attacks to the organization. Method: Important methods used to address the above objectives include: (i) a comprehensive review of the literature to better understand security and game design elements; (ii) designing a serious game using cyber security knowledge and game-based techniques combined with security requirements engineering concepts; (iii) using empirical evaluation (observation and survey) to verify the effectiveness of the proposed game design. Result: The solution proposed is a serious game for security requirements education, which: (i) can be an effective and fun way of learning security related concepts; (ii) mimics a real life problem setting in a presentable and understandable way; (iii) motivates players to learn more about security related concepts in future. Conclusion: From this study, we conclude that the proposed Security Requirement Education Game (SREG) has positive results and is helpful for players of the game to get an understanding of security attacks and vulnerabilities.}

The immune algorithm is inspired by the biological immune system that has been proven to be effective in many practical multiobjective optimization problems, with efficient convergence and search efficiency. In this paper, a novel multiobjective multifactorial immune algorithm is proposed with a novel information transfer method to solve multiobjective multitask optimization problems. For each task, information advantageous for this task will be transferred from the others to accelerate convergence through the proposed information transfer method. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary multitasking algorithms and the classic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results on the classical multiobjective multitask and the multiobjective many-task test suites demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides very promising performances.}

It follows a content and social network analysis approach to investigate the interplay of language and political partisanship in social media use, among Twitter users in Malaysia. In the period leading up to the 2013 elections, Twitter posts collected under the hashtag #GE13 reveal that communities that post in English versus the Malay language, differ in how they use Twitter and with whom they interact. As compared to English users, Malay users are more likely to seek political information and express their political opinion. In online discussions, we observe language-based homophily within the English and Malay language communities, but there are some cross-cutting interactions between opposing political communities. We discuss the implications of our findings for the political use of new communication technologies in multi-ethnic and multilingual societies.}

The purpose of this study is to fill this gap by investigating the role of cultural values in perceptions of privacy, trust and motivations for using Facebook among young Palestinians in Israel. We relied on Hall’s concept of high and low communication contexts and three of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions: collectivism, power distance and uncertainty avoidance. Data from a survey of Arab high school students (N=567) established that variations in the adoption of cultural values are associated with the motivation for using Facebook through their effect on trust and on privacy concerns. We discuss the findings and their implications.}

Within this chapter, the fundamental concepts of cognitive science are explored, encompassing the understanding of the brain, sensory motor information, language, and linguistics. This exploration encompasses the concepts of psycholinguistics and creative linguistics. Additionally, the chapter delves into the theory of information processing and the notion of short-term memory (STM). Moreover, the chapter presents case studies that revolve around the aforementioned topics of brain and sensory motor information, language and linguistic knowledge, information processing, and the concept of STM.}

In this study, we adopted basic needs theory to further explore the relationship between these two forms of participation by adopting online service recovery using tourism applications (apps) as the research context. The results indicate that two subdimensions of MCP (physical and mental participation) promote customers’ perceived autonomy, competence, and relatedness, resulting in higher online post-recovery satisfaction and VCP intentions (e.g., helping others and recommending). However, the third subdimension of MCP (emotional participation) only positively affects perceived competence. Furthermore, customer-oriented tourism apps can enhance the positive effects of physical and mental participation in terms of satisfying basic needs.}

Through the intersectional lens of information behavior in transition theory and the information journey framework, this article reports on a qualitative study investigating the information behaviors of late-life migrants who recently migrated to Australia. A narrative inquiry was conducted with 22 older Chinese migrants (aged 67 on average) who participated in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, yielding 269 pages of the transcripts and notes for analysis. Older Chinese migrants’ information behaviors were demonstrated as a five-stage information journey model driven by information seeking for migration, involving the identification of primary concerns of living, the orientation of the new setting and local information landscapes, response to the new information reality, and reconstruction of information landscapes across the transitional phases of understanding, negotiating, and resolving. The findings expand the knowledgebase on information behavior in the significant transition of late-life migration and a life event-oriented information journey. Practical implications are provided for information interventions and support that may be useful at different stages of information journey in transition.}

Influences on participant experience in crowds identified by the focus groups and observations included: physical design of crowd space and facilities (layout, queuing strategies), crowd movement (monitoring capacity, pedestrian flow), communication and information (signage, wayfinding), comfort and welfare (provision of facilities, environmental comfort), and public order. It was found that important aspects affecting participant experience are often not considered systematically in the planning of events or crowd situations. The findings point to human factors aspects of crowds being overlooked, with the experiences of participants often poor.}

abstract = {Context
Modern code reviews are supported by tools to enhance developers’ interactions allowing contributors to submit their opinions for each committed change in form of comments. Although the comments are aimed at discussing potential technical issues, the text might enclose harmful sentiments that could erode the benefits of suggested changes.
Objective
In this paper, we study empirically the impact of sentiment embodied within developers’ comments on the time and outcome of the code review process.
Method
Based on historical data of four long-lived Open Source Software (OSS) projects from a code review system we investigate whether perceived sentiments have any impact on the interval time of code changes acceptance.
Results
We found that (1) contributors frequently express positive and negative sentiments during code review activities; (2) the expressed sentiments differ among the contributors depending on their position within the social network of the reviewers (e.g., core vs peripheral contributors); (3) the sentiments expressed by contributors tend to be neutral as they progress from the status of newcomer in an OSS project to the status of core team contributors; (4) the reviews with negative comments on average took more time to complete than the reviews with positive/neutral comments, and (5) the reviews with controversial comments took significantly longer time in one project.
Conclusion
Through this work, we provide evidences that text-based sentiments have an impact on the duration of the code review process as well as the acceptance or rejection of the suggested changes.}

Searching through databases, 45 papers were located and analyzed which enabled the conceptualization of this relationship in five domains: (1) attitudes toward ICTs, (2) types of ICTs and using patterns, (3) family cohesion, (4) family roles, rules and intergenerational conflicts, and (5) family boundaries. Results show that ICTs have implied qualitative changes in family functioning, creating new interaction scenarios and rearranging current family relational patterns. Some gaps in the literature are pointed out, such as the difference operationalization of variables and the use of non-standard instruments in the studies. Suggestions are made for clinical interventions and future research in this domain.}

abstract = {Traditional ways to study urban social behavior, e.g. surveys, are costly and do not scale. Recently, some studies have been showing new ways of obtaining data through location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Foursquare, which could revolutionize the study of urban social behavior. We use Foursquare check-ins to represent user preferences regarding eating and drinking habits. Considering datasets differing in terms of volume of data and observation window size, our results indicate that spatio-temporal eating and drinking habits of users voluntarily expressed in LBSNs has the potential to explain cultural habits of the users. From this, we propose a methodology to identify cultural boundaries and similarities across populations at different scales, e.g., countries, cities, or neighborhoods. This methodology is extensively evaluated in several aspects. For instance, by proposing some variations of it disregarding some of the considered dimensions, as well as analyzing the results using datasets from different periods and window of observation. The results indicate that our proposed methodology is a promising approach for automatic cultural habits separation, which could enable new urban services.}

The packages were electronically presented to the subjects on the computer screen. A binary pairwise procedure within the framework of the conjoint analysis was employed to assess the examinees’ preferences. The experimental stimuli differed in the brand name location in relation to the product image (left and right hand side), background colors used (grey and pink), and the typography applied to the brand name (big and compact text versus small with the increased interletter spacing). The main results showed significant effects of brand name location and typography along with significant interactions concerned with the background package color. Generally, males preferred grey variants while females – pink. These results analyzed along with the conjoint analysis outcomes surprisingly show that the background color was the main factor influencing males’ preferences while for women it was the least important issue. The cluster analysis results demonstrated significant interpersonal discrepancies and identified three, similar in number, groups sharing common preference structures.}

Such claims are unscientific primarily for two reasons, (1) They incorrectly enforce the notion that task-specific performance can be treated as manifestation of General Intelligence and (2) They are not verifiable as currently there is no set benchmark for measuring human-like cognition in a machine learning agent. Moreover, ML agent’s performance is influenced by knowledge ingested in it by its human designers. Therefore, agent’s performance may not necessarily reflect its true cognition. In this paper, we propose a framework that draws parallels from human cognition to measure machine’s cognition. Human cognitive learning is quite well studied in developmental psychology with frameworks and metrics in place to measure actual learning. To either believe or refute the claims of human-level performance of machine learning agent, we need scientific methodology to measure its cognition. Our framework formalizes incremental implementation of human-like cognitive processes in ML agents with an implicit goal to measure it. The framework offers guiding principles for measuring, (1) Task-specific machine cognition and (2) General machine cognition that spans across tasks. The framework also provides guidelines for building domain-specific task taxonomies to cognitively profile tasks. We demonstrate application of the framework with a case study where two ML agents that perform Vision and NLP tasks are cognitively evaluated.}

Recently, companies and research groups have announced that they have been employing health software frameworks. This paper presents the design, proof-of-concept implementations and experimentation of the Health Surveillance Software Framework (HSSF). The HSSF is a framework that tackles the demand for the recommendation of surveillance information aiming at supporting preventive healthcare strategies. Examples of such strategies are the automatic recommendation of surveillance levels to patients in need of healthcare and the automatic recommendation of scientific literature that elucidates epigenetic problems related to patients. HSSF was created from two systems we developed in our previous work on health surveillance systems: the Automatic-SL and CISS systems. The Automatic-SL system aims to assist healthcare professionals in making decisions and in identifying children with developmental problems. The CISS service associates genetic and epigenetic risk factors related to chronic diseases with patient’s clinical records. Towards evaluating the HSSF framework, two new systems, CISS+ and CISS-SW, were created by means of abstractions and instantiations of the framework (design and code). We show that HSSF supported the development of the two new systems given that they both recommend scientific papers using medical records as queries even though they exploit different computational technologies. In an experiment using simulated patients’ medical records, we show that CISS, CISS+, and CISS-SW systems recommended more closely related and somewhat related documents than Google, Google Scholar and PubMed. Considering recall and precision measures, CISS+ surpasses CISS-SW in terms of precision.}

Specifically, we identify seven MWT functions of mGovernment and explore the underlying process through which the seven MWT functions affect user satisfaction. By integrating the task-technology fit perspective and theory of procedural fairness, we develop a research model to demonstrate that the seven MWT functions of mGovernment reshape three characteristics of fair decision procedures and increase the procedural fairness of governmental services, which, in turn, improve user satisfaction. A total of 449 experienced users in China responded to a survey. The results indicate that 1) two time-critical functions of mGovernment improve transparency, 2) a location-sensitive function and a mobile multimedia function promote information accuracy and 3) three personal control functions increase voice opportunity. Further, the three fair procedural characteristics (i.e., transparency, information accuracy and voice) increase procedural fairness of governmental services, which, in turn, increases user satisfaction. This study results in a theoretical contribution to e/mGovernment and mobile service literature by explaining “which” and “how” MWT functions affect user satisfaction. Moreover, it applies and complements theory of procedural fairness in the context of mGovernment. This study also suggests guidelines for government agencies and system developers on selecting a suitable portfolio of MWT functions to fit government's various task needs and to improve user satisfaction.}

According to the experimental results, CoNBiLSTM generally outperforms the approach using SVM with shallow syntactic structures (STRUCT) – the current state-of-the-art sentiment analysis on the SenTube dataset. In addition, our model achieves more robustness across domains than the STRUCT (e.g. 7.47% of the difference in performance between the two domains for our model vs. 18.8% for the STRUCT)}

abstract = {In this article, we argue in favor of a macro-societal approach to protect people from the potential harms of personal information online. In the tension between information and privacy, “the right to be forgotten” is not an appropriate solution. Such a micro, individual-based answer puts the burden of protection on each person instead of on external entities that can abuse such knowledge. The personal responsibility to delete personal data is challenging because of the leakage of data that happens through the connections we have with others, many of whom do not share the same privacy preferences. We show that effective deletion is almost impossible (the eternity effect), and is unfair due to the resource burden it entails when users try to achieve it, while at the same time ensuring the potential benefits we can derive in the future from having personal information online. In addition, deletion requests can negatively affect other people who are in the same location and time frame and may not want to have their information deleted. Collectively, we argue also that society is worse off because these circumstances lead people to construct sanitized personas while perpetuating a culture of distrust. Given that the harm is real, we describe technology, societal norms, and the implementation of an anti-discrimination directive for the right to a personal life, and we provide evidence on how anti-discrimination efforts in the past have succeeded when legislation leads to the development of infrastructures that help to enforce them. The dissemination of personal information through public sites and social media is, as Mozart suggested in Cosi fan tutte, gradually educating humanity about human weaknesses.}

This was later refined to use measures that could be used to discriminate individuals, especially using descriptions that can be perceived using human vision and in surveillance imagery. A further branch of this new field concerns approaches to estimate soft biometrics, either using conventional biometrics approaches or just from images alone. These three strands combine to form what is now known as soft biometrics. We survey the achievements that have been made in recognition by and in estimation of these parameters, describing how these approaches can be used and where they might lead to. The approaches lead to a new type of recognition, and one similar to Bertillonage which is one of the earliest approaches to human identification.}

To address issues of multi-culturalism, we used a creative choice of methods, which included elements of boundary critique, the Viable System Model, rich pictures and social cartography research. We explore the possibilities that this mixed methods approach to COR offers to clarify the core dilemmas and paradoxes of self-governance for sustainability that such communities are facing. The analysis is done through VSM mapping of the community, at different levels and scales of organisation. Our analysis reveals key paradoxes and dilemmas of self-governance, which is helping them to collectively decide on action paths and their needs to (re) develop certain adaptive capabilities. In particular, we show that loss of power from traditional (spiritual) authorities, and loss of rituals and other cooperative practices have negatively affected indigenous ways of implementing life plans and respecting sustainability principles. This research contributes to COR, in presenting an innovative application of the VSM in an indigenous community, supported by expert facilitation, as the basis for reflecting on their self- governance challenges and acting upon them. It takes into account a more critical and ethnographic approach to research, capable of better dealing with the variety of a multi-cultural context.}

We conduct a computational cross dialectal lexical distance study to measure the similarities and differences between dialects and the MSA. We exploit several methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) like Vector Space Model (VSM), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Hellinger Distance (HD), and apply them on different Arabic dialectal corpora. We measure the overlap among all the dialects and compute the frequencies of the most frequent words in every dialect.

abstract = {Emotion classification plays a crucial role in the domain of human–computer interaction, as it holds substantial significance in effective communication. However, the task of emotion classification presents notable challenges primarily due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of emotions, encompassing varying cultural and individual interpretations. Numerous methodologies have been employed to address the complexities associated with facial emotion classification. Notably, contemporary techniques such as those that consider emotion-relevant features (e.g. mouth, eyes) have demonstrated a certain degree of success in comparison to alternative approaches (e.g. the widely employed end-to-end deep networks), which consider all pixel information in an image with equal importance. Nonetheless, a comprehensive set of guidelines evaluating not only the strengths, but also the weaknesses of deep networks remains absent. These approaches are vulnerable to even minor alterations in images, regardless of their relevance to emotion classification, e.g. a change in the foreground color of the image can reduce the accuracy of these methods by a significant amount. This results in a fragmented field, ultimately missing opportunities to enhance performance for emerging real-world applications. Therefore to address this issue, this paper offers a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art datasets and research, providing insights into different techniques and their unique contributions to emotion categorization. We also thoroughly analyze current challenges and issues, laying the groundwork for promising future research directions. Our review reveals the significance of considering contemporary methods, particularly in contrast to widely used deep networks, and their potential to enhance performance and application success.}

abstract = {Recognition of intentions is a subconscious cognitive process vital to human communication. This skill enables anticipation and increases the quality of interactions between humans. Within the context of engagement, non-verbal signals are used to communicate the intention of starting the interaction with a partner. In this paper, we investigated methods to detect these signals in order to allow a robot to know when it is about to be addressed. Originality of our approach resides in taking inspiration from social and cognitive sciences to perform our perception task. We investigate meaningful features, i.e. human readable features, and elicit which of these are important for recognizing someone’s intention of starting an interaction. Classically, spatial information like the human position and speed, the human–robot distance are used to detect the engagement. Our approach integrates multimodal features gathered using a companion robot equipped with a Kinect. The evaluation on our corpus collected in spontaneous conditions highlights its robustness and validates the use of such a technique in a real environment. Experimental validation shows that multimodal features set gives better precision and recall than using only spatial and speed features. We also demonstrate that 7 selected features are sufficient to provide a good starting engagement detection score. In our last investigation, we show that among our full 99 features set, the space reduction is not a solved task. This result opens new researches perspectives on multimodal engagement detection.}

Traditional P2P file sharing systems focus on performance and scalability, disregarding any privacy or legal issues that may arise from their use. Lacking alternatives, and unaware of the privacy issues that arise from relaying traffic of insecure applications, users have adopted anonymity systems for P2P file sharing. This work aims at hiding user content interests from malicious peers through plausible deniability. The Mistrustful P2P model is built on the concept of mistrusting all the entities participating in the P2P network, hence its name. It provides a deterministic and configurable privacy protection that relies on cover content downloads to hide user content interests, has no trust requirements, and introduces several mechanisms to prevent user legal liability and reduce network overhead while enabling timely content downloads. We extend previous work on the Mistrustful P2P model by discussing its legal and ethical framework, assessing its feasibility for more use cases, providing a security analysis, comparing it against a traditional P2P file sharing model, and further defining and improving its main mechanisms.}

The satisfaction level is a unique parameter that has not previously been applied in this field. This study focuses on the stochastic model because of its ability to handle uncertainty in the parameters of the optimization model. Real data are utilized and applied in this research. Three types of universities are investigated including medical/doctoral universities, comprehensive universities, and primarily undergraduate universities. According to the results, there is some room for improvement of the efficiency in Ontario universities. Furthermore, the results of this study show that the selection of inputs and outputs plays a crucial role in determining the ranks of universities using DEA. The results also are discussed with details for each category. For instance, increasing the number of publications is a prominent factor to rise the efficiency scores of undergraduate universities.}

From the understated elegance of Japanese architecture to overwrought European Gothic structures, design is as much an expression of culture as it is of time and place. But, for all of its explosive variety, is there an actual universal sense of design? Do humans use essentially the same rules, only with different purposes and sensibilities? Our cognition and intellectual prowess is remarkably similar across cultures, so why are there so many variations on such disparate themes? The essential mechanisms of our mind that make us closer to each other are also the ones that make us closer to the laws of the universe: geometry, patterns, and language. Yet each one of these can be used in a different manner depending on the dominating preferences and tastes of our surroundings. This chapter proposes to analyse these very differences, be it in the input we provide the systems we interact with–or the output.}

The two most important bibliographic databases, Web of Science and Scopus, each provide a journal classification system. However, no study has systematically investigated the accuracy of these classification systems. To examine and compare the accuracy of journal classification systems, we define two criteria on the basis of direct citation relations between journals and categories. We use Criterion I to select journals that have weak connections with their assigned categories, and we use Criterion II to identify journals that are not assigned to categories with which they have strong connections. If a journal satisfies either of the two criteria, we conclude that its assignment to categories may be questionable. Accordingly, we identify all journals with questionable classifications in Web of Science and Scopus. Furthermore, we perform a more in-depth analysis for the field of Library and Information Science to assess whether our proposed criteria are appropriate and whether they yield meaningful results. It turns out that according to our citation-based criteria Web of Science performs significantly better than Scopus in terms of the accuracy of its journal classification system.}

This paper constructs an online data-driven quantitative brand image assessment method using the classic brand image theory as a conceptual model. The method is organized as follows. First, with domain expert knowledge and deep learning, this paper constructs a task ontology to clearly describe the brand image constituent content, constituent relationship, properties, and property values. Then, using the task ontology as a priori knowledge, we identify the content of brand associations from User-generated Content (UGC) and Firm-generated content (FGC), respectively, and calculate the associations’ favorability, strength and uniqueness; classify brand associations into three categories: functional, experiential, and symbolic to achieve a dual-perspectives (consumer perceptions & corporate claims) brand image assessment. Finally, this study compares the dual-perspective brand images from the components and benefits to construct a brand image communication and maintenance strategy. The development and validation of the methodology take the Chinese New Energy Vehicle (NEV) market as the analysis object. The proposed dual-perspective brand image quantitative assessment model is a new development of brand image evaluation and maintenance theoretical method in the digital era. It is also a practical tool for brand management in enterprises.}

abstract = {"Risk to fundamental rights,", "impact on fundamental rights", "harm to fundamental rights" and "non-material damages" are all terms referring to similar problems, though inherently ambiguous and very problematic, especially in the age of AI-based technologies and digital platforms. Traditionally, legal and social sciences have two different approaches to analysing the impacts on fundamental rights: the rights-based approach and the risk of harm-based approach to fundamental rights. The rights-based approach is binary, focusing on whether rights and obligations are respected or violated. In contrast, a harm-based approach focuses on the anticipation of undesired events and measuring their likelihood and severity. However, focusing solely on "harms'' or "damages'' is reductionist, while existing impact assessment models often use vague terms like "gravity", "intensity," and "magnitude", which do not effectively help measure interferences with fundamental rights. Without operational criteria to measure these risks, most EU digital strategies demanding impact and risk assessments fail. Examples include the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) in the GDPR, Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments (FRIA) in the AI Act, and systemic risk assessments in the Digital Services Act (DSA). We posit that interferences with fundamental rights are seen as a spectrum that ranges from social contacts to violations, and these interferences can and should be measured. Thus, this article proposes a rights-based approach, combining it with elements from the harm approach and proposes an actionable parameter-based framework (also based on social meaning theories and social perception methodologies) to assess impacts on fundamental rights. The proposed multi-metric approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of the severity of impacts on fundamental rights within EU law, particularly in GDPR, DSA, and AI Act. This approach aims to inform policymaking, prioritise high-risk scenarios and propose mitigation measures in digital markets. This is especially important for detecting and addressing human vulnerabilities in interactions with digital technologies.}

For empirical analysis, we first extracted parliamentarians’ followee network connections from their Twitter accounts (36 294 nodes and 113 108 edges) and combined it with data from a national voting advice application, which includes information regarding parliamentarians' societal position and opinions regarding social, cultural and economic issues. According to the explanatory analysis, we found that connections between parliamentarians and the share of mutual followees are clearly based on matching values, similar background and shared contextual factors. Additionally, we found that shared context had strong confounding effects on the function of value homophily in relations and shared networks between Finnish parliamentarians.}

abstract = {Temporal representation and reasoning are important facets in the design of many Semantic Web applications. Several approaches exist to represent and reason about precise temporal data in ontology. However, most of them handle only time intervals and associated qualitative relations. Besides, to the best of our knowledge, there is no approach devoted to handle imprecise temporal data (e.g., “late 1970s”). In this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach for representing and reasoning about precise and imprecise temporal data. Quantitative temporal data (i.e., time intervals and points) and qualitative ones (i.e., relations between time intervals, relations between a time interval and a time point and relations between time points) are taken into consideration. Our approach is three folds: (i) extending the 4D-fluents approach with new crisp and fuzzy components, to represent precise and imprecise temporal data, (ii) extending the Allen’s interval algebra to enable reasoning about precise and imprecise temporal data, and (iii) creating a Fuzzy-OWL 2 ontology TimeOnto that, based on the extended Allen’s interval algebra, instantiates our 4D-fluents-based representation. The extension that we propose for the Allen’s interval algebra handles precise and imprecise time intervals. Indeed, it enables expressing precise (e.g., “before”) and imprecise (e.g., “just before”) temporal relations. Compared to related work, our imprecise relations are personalized, in the sense that they are not limited to a defined set of interval relations and their meanings are determined by the domain expert. For instance, the classic Allen’s relation “Before” may be generalized in 5 imprecise relations, where “Before(1)” means “just before” and gradually the time gap between the two intervals increases until “Before(5)” which means “very long before”. To enable this representation, we propose an extension of the Vilain and Kautz’s point algebra and redefined the Allen’s relations by means of this extended algebra. We show in this paper that, unlike most related work, the resulting relations preserve many of the desirable properties of the Allen’s interval algebra. The definitions of the resulting interval relations are adapted to allow relating a time interval and a time point, and two time points, where time intervals and points maybe both precise or both imprecise. These relations can be used for temporal reasoning by means of four transitivity tables. Finally, we describe a prototype based on “TimeOnto” that infers new relations using a set of SWRL and fuzzy IF-THEN rules. This prototype was integrated in an ontology-based memory prosthesis for Alzheimer’s patients.}

A first challenge is elaborating a framework that distinguishes between the co-elaboration of knowledge types (cognitive, linguistic, social, technological…), yet shows their connections. A second challenge is distinguishing co-elaboration of knowledge from self and social regulation of knowledge elaboration. Knowing what knowledge you are regulating may facilitate knowledge regulation. Meeting the first challenge allows us to combine research from different traditions in order to broaden understanding. Meeting the second helps determine how to support the regulation of knowledge elaboration. As a first step towards meeting these challenges, we propose 1) the logical space of knowledge elaboration and its regulation and 2) a multi-theoretical, interdisciplinary model called Multi-grain collaborative knowledge construction that concerns how individuals and groups co-elaborate knowledge during group interactions. We instantiate this model with two illustrations (physics learning and collaborative game learning) and their corresponding logical spaces of elaboration and regulation. Results reveal how knowledge regulation occurs through action and not just verbalization, that regulation interventions are multifunctional, that meta knowledge about learning can help regulation, that knowledge acquired during development is more difficult to regulate. A roadmap is proposed for furthering the distinction between knowledge elaboration and regulation.}

In addition, five innovative organizational models were selected as strategic alternatives: continuous learning organization, technology-oriented policy development, income diversification, pluralistic governance, and transformational leadership. The empirical data were gathered through interviews with 16 experts from academia, civil society, and public institutions in Türkiye. To address the complexity and uncertainty of decision-making processes, a hybrid type-2 neutrosophic number (T2NN) multi-criteria decision-making methodology is introduced. The T2NN-ranking comparison and T2NN-criteria importance through intercriteria correlation methods are used to determine the weight of criteria, while T2NN-stable preference ordering towards ideal solution is utilized to rank the alternative models. Results show that the level of institutionalization is the most significant criterion, and income diversification is the most effective organizational model for improving NGO sustainability. The study not only provides practical guidance for NGO leaders but also introduces a robust methodological approach applicable to governance challenges under uncertain conditions.}

This study identifies new positive factors to the Internet usage, as problem-solving skills, proactive study, information gathering, and awareness globally and locally; communication and collaboration with their peers and family were improved and enhanced. Alternatively, this study identifies new negative factors as physical contact and physical activities were prevented, thinking, concentrating and memory skills were reduced, depressed and isolated, laziness having increased, nevertheless; the Internet encourages Gens Y and Z to play physical and virtual games (e.g. Wii). Finally, this study concluded that the Internet is becoming an essential part of the everyday routines and practices of Gens Y and Z.}

abstract = {Prototype Generation (PG) methods are typically considered for improving the efficiency of the k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifier when tackling high-size corpora. Such approaches aim at generating a reduced version of the corpus without decreasing the classification performance when compared to the initial set. Despite their large application in multiclass scenarios, very few works have addressed the proposal of PG methods for the multilabel space. In this regard, this work presents the novel adaptation of four multiclass PG strategies to the multilabel case. These proposals are evaluated with three multilabel kNN-based classifiers, 12 corpora comprising a varied range of domains and corpus sizes, and different noise scenarios artificially induced in the data. The results obtained show that the proposed adaptations are capable of significantly improving—both in terms of efficiency and classification performance—the only reference multilabel PG work in the literature as well as the case in which no PG method is applied, also presenting statistically superior robustness in noisy scenarios. Moreover, these novel PG strategies allow prioritising either the efficiency or efficacy criteria through its configuration depending on the target scenario, hence covering a wide area in the solution space not previously filled by other works.}

Results revealed that the perspectives of African American women towards online collaborative learning could be categorized into three themes: (a) peer support perceived as a give-and-take process with a sense of fairness, (b) group member role as a formation of identity, and c) “frustration” as a common response to differing levels of peer participation and interaction. These emerging factors reflected African American women’s perceptions towards online collaborative learning and provided profound implications for future research and practice.}

abstract = {Handling data imperfection is a crucial issue in many application domains. This is particularly true when handling imperfect data inputs in applications for Alzheimer’s patients. In this paper we first propose a typology of imperfection for data entered by Alzheimer’s patients or their caregivers in the context of these applications (mainly due to the memory discordance caused by the disease). This topology includes nine direct and three indirect imperfection types. The direct ones are deduced from the data inputs e.g. uncertainty and uselessness. The indirect imperfection types are deduced from the direct ones, e.g. the redundancy. We then propose an approach, called DBE_ALZ, that handles false data entry by estimating the believability of each data input. Based on the proposed typology, the falsity of these data is related to five imperfection types: uncertainty, confusion, typing error, wrong knowledge and inconsistency. DBE_ALZ includes a believability model that defines a set of dimensions and sub-dimensions allowing a qualitative estimation of the believability of a given data input. It is estimated based on its reasonableness and the reliability of its author. Compared to related work, the data input reasonableness is measured not only based on common-sense standard, but also based on a set of personalized assertions. The reliability of the patient is estimated based on the progression of the disease and the state of his memory at the moment of entry. However, the reliability of the caregiver is estimated based on his age and his knowledge about the data input’s field. Based on the believability model, we estimate quantitatively the believability of the data input by defining a set of metrics associated to the proposed dimensions and sub-dimensions. The measurement methods rely on probability and fuzzy set theories to reason about uncertain and imprecise knowledge (Bayesian networks and Mamdani fuzzy inference systems). Three languages are supported: English, French and Arabic. Based on the generated believability degrees, a set of decisive actions are proposed to guarantee the quality of the data inputs e.g., inferring or not based on a given data. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach in the context of the Captain Memo memory prosthesis. Finally, we discuss the encouraging results derived from the evaluation step.}

Scarcity of pertinent data, however, makes it hard to determine whether accident characteristics, causal factors and remedial interventions identified elsewhere apply to the Gulf in comparable ways. This difficulty stems from unusual construction sector characteristics, notably a heterogeneous mix of expatriate laborers and firms working without a common language, work culture or labor practices. Does this change the mix of accident types or the ranking of main causes and priority remedies? To answer this question, a sample of 519 incident records was analyzed to determine whether accident types and frequencies are comparable to elsewhere. Site safety experts were then interviewed to determine whether rankings of factors and interventions should be similar. Findings are that types are indeed comparable, but the rankings of factors and interventions may not be. Main factors have to do with worker skills and training, experience, use of safety gear and risk perception. The overarching safety issue, however, is that firms and governments do not have strong incentive to address these factors.}

abstract = {Background
Internet- and mobile-based mental health interventions have the potential to narrow the treatment gap in ethnic groups. Little evidence exists on the cultural adaptation of such interventions. Cultural adaptation of evidence-based interventions distinguishes between surface and deep structure adaptation. Surface refers to matching materials (e.g., illustrations, language) or methods of treatment delivery to the target population, whereas deep structure adaptation considers cultural concepts of distress (CCD). So far, CCD have only been considered to a limited extent in cultural adaptation of psychological interventions, and there is a lack of well documented adaptation procedures.
Aims
With a cross-disciplinary and mixed-method approach, following a new conceptual framework for cultural adaptation of scalable psychological interventions, this study aimed to develop both surface and deep structure adaptations of an internet- and mobile-based intervention called Hap-pas-Hapi for the treatment of psychological distress among Albanian migrants in Switzerland and Germany.
Methods
A qualitative ethnopsychological study was conducted to examine the target group's CCD. Focus group discussions, an online survey, and individual key informant interviews were utilised to evaluate the original intervention, adaptation drafts and the final adapted intervention. A reporting system was developed to support the decision-making process and to report all adaptations in a transparent and replicable way.
Results
The ongoing involvement of target population key informants provided valuable feedback for the development of a more person-centred intervention, which might enhance treatment acceptance, motivation and adherence.
Discussion
This study provides empirical and theory-based considerations and suggestions for future implementation that may foster acceptability and effectiveness of culturally adapted evidence-based interventions.}

In our empirical analysis we examine the general use of social media as well as its use for political purposes with the aid of a nationally representative dataset, collected in 2017–2018 from 3724 Finnish citizens. We argue that there are notable differences between parties when examining their supporters’ social media use for political purposes. The differences are related to the digital divides and political extremes. The results confirmed the idea that new political movements made up of younger and more educated supporters have been successful by leveraging social media. The study also revealed that the ideological gap between party supporters is greater in social media especially when examining new kinds of politics based on cultural questions, identity issues, and post-materialist values.}

This paper focuses on set-valued predicates, i.e., the relationship between an entity and a set of entities. In KBs, this information is often represented in two formats: (i) via counting predicates such as numberOfChildren and staffSize, that store aggregated integers, and (ii) via enumerating predicates such as parentOf and worksFor, that store individual set memberships. Both formats are typically complementary: unlike enumerating predicates, counting predicates do not give away individuals, but are more likely informative towards the true set size, thus this coexistence could enable interesting applications in question answering and KB curation. In this paper we aim at uncovering this hidden knowledge. We proceed in two steps. (i) We identify set-valued predicates from a given KB predicates via statistical and embedding-based features. (ii) We link counting predicates and enumerating predicates by a combination of co-occurrence, correlation and textual relatedness metrics. We analyse the prevalence of count information in four prominent knowledge bases, and show that our linking method achieves up to 0.55 F1 score in set predicate identification versus 0.40 F1 score of a random selection, and normalized discounted gains of up to 0.84 at position 1 and 0.75 at position 3 in relevant predicate alignments. Our predicate alignments are showcased in a demonstration system available at https://counqer.mpi-inf.mpg.de/spo.}

Survey data were collected from 1155 undergraduate students in a US public university. Findings showed that the bifactor model was the best fitting model and SAS is a unidimensional instrument. The composite scores made for the six domain-specific factors, often seen in the literature, were not reliable measures for the construct of smartphone addiction and can result in misleading or even incorrect inferential test results. The most reliable and contributing items identified by the bifactor model were selected to form a short, more efficient version of SAS. A Rasch model was performed to test the psychometric properties of the shortened SAS. The new shortened SAS contains 10 items (SAS-10) and had good reliability, construct validity, and no presence of bias towards students in different gender or academic achievement groups. Additional evidence suggests a 4-category rating scale is enough to capture the construct of smartphone addiction. Finally, SAS-10 correlated to numerous external criterion variables similarly to how the extant literature would predict. SAS-10 is provided in appendix C.}

abstract = {Background
The ubiquitous presence and functionality of mobile devices offers the potential for mobile health (mHealth) to create equitable health opportunities. While mHealth is used among First Nations populations to respond to health challenges, the characteristics, uptake, and effectiveness of these interventions are unclear.
Objective
This review aimed to identify the characteristics of mHealth interventions (eg, study locations, health topic, and modality) evaluated with First Nations populations and to summarize the outcomes reported for intervention use, user perspectives including cultural responsiveness, and clinical effectiveness. In addition, the review sought to identify the presence of First Nations expertise in the design and evaluation of mHealth interventions with First Nations populations.
Methods
The methods of this systematic review were detailed in a registered protocol with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42019123276). Systematic searches of peer-reviewed, scientific papers were conducted across 7 databases in October 2018. Eligible studies had a primary focus on mHealth interventions with experimental or quasi-experimental design to respond to a health challenge with First Nations people from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Two authors independently screened records for eligibility and assessed risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Data were synthesized narratively owing to the mix of study designs, interventions, and outcomes. The review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
Results
Searches yielded 1053 unique records, after review and screening, 13 studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 8 quasi-experimental designs) were included in the final analysis. Studies were conducted in Australia (n=9), the United States (n=2), and New Zealand (n=2). The most common health challenge addressed was mental health and suicide (n=5). Intervention modalities included text messaging (n=5), apps (n=4), multimedia messaging (n=1), tablet software (n=1), or a combination of short messaging service (SMS) and apps (n=1). Results showed mixed engagement with the intervention (n=3); favorable user perspectives, including acceptability and cultural appropriateness (n=6); and mixed outcomes for clinical effectiveness (n=10). A diverse range of risks of bias were identified, the most common of which included a lack of clarity about allocation and blinding protocols and group treatment for randomized controlled trials and a lack of control group and single outcome measures for quasi-experimental designs. First Nations expertise informed all mHealth studies, through authorship (n=8), affiliation with First Nations bodies (n=3), participatory study design (n=5), First Nations reference groups (n=5), or a combination of these.
Conclusions
mHealth modalities, including SMS and apps, appear favorable for delivery of health interventions with First Nations populations, particularly in the area of mental health and suicide prevention. Importantly, First Nations expertise was strongly embedded within the studies, augmenting favorable use and user engagement. However, evidence of efficacy is limited.}

In response, cybersecurity exercises, and in particular—cyber defence exercises (CDX) are becoming ever more popular. They provide a training platform to simulate real-life situations. CDX are significant events involving months of preparation, and previous studies show a lack of objective evidence of their relevance regarding the learning impact. Skills of exercise participants are usually different and vary from tech-savvy to beginners. Also, trainees are diverse when considering their background, current work profile (position and institution), and experience. Assessment of their competencies is essential to ensure quality in training. The complexity and multi-dimensionality of the usual CDX make it challenging. Additionally, the costly event usually focuses on just a subset of participants, and non-technical members of an organisation are not included. The goal of our research is to provide a proper methodology to optimise the exercises so that every team and each participant, including a non-technical trainee, are adequately evaluated and trained using the allocated resources most effectively. This paper presents a framework to aid in the development and assessment of cybersecurity competences of all teams during hybrid CDX. The framework aims towards raised cybersecurity awareness—a state when every user of digital technologies understands the associated risks. The framework consists of a sequence of steps including stages of formative assessment, team construction, determination of objectives for different types of teams, and the exercise flow. It complements standard methodologies for cybersecurity training programs. The framework was developed based on data collected using questionnaires, interviews, and direct observation in a case study carried out during international cybersecurity exercises. The framework would help organise hybrid exercises for a diverse community of trainees, including non-technical members of an organisation.}

The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach were evaluated in an empirical study with encouraging results. These results especially reveal that our suggested approach enables less-experienced individuals to identify a higher number of requirements. Our results also reveal that for the majority of subjects, especially individuals with less technical experience, this approach was a pleasant and easy way of participating in requirements elicitation.

Next, relations with similar semantics are grouped into clusters by exploiting syntactic dependencies. These relations are ranked thanks to a novel confidence measure based on statistical and linguistic evidence. Evaluation is carried out intrinsically, by assessing each component of the pipeline, as well as in an extrinsic task, in which we evaluate the contribution of natural language explanations in music recommendation. We demonstrate that our method is able to discover novel facts with high precision, which are missing in current generic as well as music-specific knowledge repositories.}

abstract = {Nowadays, spatial and temporal data play an important role in social networks. These data are distributed and dispersed in several heterogeneous data sources. These peculiarities make that geographic information retrieval being a non-trivial task, considering that the spatial data are often unstructured and built by different collaborative communities from social networks. The problem arises when user queries are performed with different levels of semantic granularity. This fact is very typical in social communities, where users have different levels of expertise. In this paper, a novelty approach based on three matching-query layers driven by ontologies on the heterogeneous data sources is presented. A technique of query contextualization is proposed for addressing to available heterogeneous data sources including social networks. It consists of contextualizing a query in which whether a data source does not contain a relevant result, other sources either provide an answer or in the best case, each one adds a relevant answer to the set of results. This approach is a collaborative learning system based on experience level of users in different domains. The retrieval process is achieved from three domains: temporal, geographical and social, which are involved in the user-content context. The work is oriented towards defining a GIScience collaborative learning for geographic information retrieval, using social networks, web and geodatabases.}

These domains are primarily concentrated within nonprofit services and local development. However, there are many other disciplines and application areas for which novel applications and extensions of Community OR could generate valuable insights. This paper identifies a number of these, distinguishing between ‘emerging trends’ (mostly in well-studied areas of operational research, management science and analytics) and ‘new frontiers’, which can be found in traditions not commonly oriented towards empirical and analytical methods for problem solving, where community-engaged decision modeling represents new ways of generating knowledge, policies and prescriptions. This paper will show how the exploration of emerging trends and new frontiers in Community OR can provide a basis for the development of innovative research agendas that can broaden the scope and impact of the decision sciences.}

Guide to the software engineering body of knowledge (SWEBOK) which has evolved to become ISO/IEC 19759 standard has identified various knowledge areas to be part of any SE curricula. Although there is a number of studies that address the gap between SE curricula and software industry, the literature lacks defining a process that can be leveraged for continuously improving SE curricula to fulfill the software development market demands. Objective: In this paper, we propose a Software Engineering Curricula Development and Evaluation Process (SECDEP) that takes advantage of the SWEBOK guidelines to improve the quality of SE programs based on objective and subjective evidences. Method: Our process consists of multi-steps in which the local software market needs and the target SE program objectives and constraints are all taken into consideration. As a case study, we follow our process to investigate the core SE courses delivered as part of the SE curricula in a set of universities in our region. Results: The conducted case study identifies the factors that might contribute to mitigating the skills shortages in the target software market. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our process by identifying the weaknesses of the studied SE curricula and presenting recommendations to align the studied curricula with the demands of the target software market, which assists SE educators in the design and evaluation of their SE curricula. Conclusion: Based on the obtained results, the studied SE curricula can be enhanced by incorporating latest SE technologies, covering most of the SWEBOK knowledge areas, adopting SE curricula standards, and increasing the level of industrial involvement in SE curricula. We believe that achieving these enhancements by SE educators will have a positive impact on the SE curricula in question.}

abstract = {Context: Diversification and obfuscation are promising techniques for securing software and protecting computers from harmful malware. The goal of these techniques is not removing the security holes, but making it difficult for the attacker to exploit security vulnerabilities and perform successful attacks. Objective: There is an increasing body of research on the use of diversification and obfuscation techniques for improving software security; however, the overall view is scattered and the terminology is unstructured. Therefore, a coherent review gives a clear statement of state-of-the-art, normalizes the ongoing discussion and provides baselines for future research. Method: In this paper, systematic literature review is used as the method of the study to select the studies that discuss diversification/obfuscation techniques for improving software security. We present the process of data collection, analysis of data, and report the results. Results: As the result of the systematic search, we collected 357 articles relevant to the topic of our interest, published between the years 1993 and 2017. We studied the collected articles, analyzed the extracted data from them, presented classification of the data, and enlightened the research gaps. Conclusion: The two techniques have been extensively used for various security purposes and impeding various types of security attacks. There exist many different techniques to obfuscate/diversify programs, each of which targets different parts of the programs and is applied at different phases of software development life-cycle. Moreover, we pinpoint the research gaps in this field, for instance that there are still various execution environments that could benefit from these two techniques, including cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and trusted computing. We also present some potential ideas on applying the techniques on the discussed environments.}

Causal relationships are tested by a model of structural equations. A non-probabilistic convenience sample composed of mobile buyers from Chile and Mexico is used. The results show that the m-shopper's satisfaction with their online shopping experience is a consequence of the reputation and trust that they perceive of mobile commerce. In turn, it is confirmed that satisfaction is a reaction to the affective evaluation of the mobile shopper. Affective evaluation is understood as the result of the hedonic and functional attributes perceived by mobile shoppers in their online shopping experience. Among m-shoppers from Chile and Mexico, differences are observed in the relationships between reputation and trust and between functional benefit and affective evaluation. This study contains some implications for mobile commerce managers who want to improve mobile buyer satisfaction.}

Understanding avatar design influence is essential as it increasingly shapes online consumer experiences. Although research exists, the combined effects of form and behavioral realism on consumer interaction responses remain underexplored. Through in-depth interviews with 45 participants across Generations X, Millennials (Y), and Z, this research identifies key design elements that enhance avatar design. Findings indicate that the spatial dimension of avatars, including variations in shape, significantly contributes to form realism. Additionally, behavioral elements such as communication modalities, competence, empathy, and dynamic interactions enhance behavioral realism. Also, we find significant differences in the cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses to avatar interaction across generations. These interactive responses are also influenced by contingency factors such as inter-avatar dynamics, media channel preferences (mobile versus fixed devices), and privacy risk. We propose a framework for aligning avatars’ design typology to enhance consumer interaction, offering valuable insights for marketers and designers aiming to optimize avatar-driven experiences across age groups.}

Specifically, the FELIDS system protects data privacy through local learning, where devices benefit from the knowledge of their peers by sharing only updates from their model with an aggregation server that produces an improved detection model. In order to prevent Agricultural IoTs attacks, the FELIDS system employs three deep learning classifiers, namely, deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. We study the performance of the proposed IDS on three different sources, including, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, MQTTset, and InSDN. The results demonstrate that the FELIDS system outperforms the classic/centralized versions of machine learning (non-federated learning) in protecting the privacy of IoT devices data and achieves the highest accuracy in detecting attacks.}

This study, through an empirical investigation among citizens in three countries – the USA, India, and Bangladesh, has identified that citizens are quite satisfied with this new service delivery channel use by the public service domain. The success of this delivery channel depends on the issue of segmentation. If public service providers can effectively segment the market based on time, location, and requirements, and can deliver the preferred message to concerned users with relevant and information that is easy to access and process, citizens will regard this service delivery channel as effective and satisfactory, and as competent as its private counterparts.}

Accordingly, studies on geospatial semantics usually focus on understanding the meaning of geographic entities as well as their counterparts in the cognitive and digital world, such as cognitive geographic concepts and digital gazetteers. geospatial semantics can facilitate the design of geographic information systems by enhancing the interoperability of distributed systems and developing more intelligent interfaces for user interactions. During the past years, a lot of research has been conducted, approaching geospatial semantics from different perspectives, using a variety of methods, and targeting different problems. Meanwhile, the arrival of big geo data, especially the large amount of unstructured text data on the Web, and the fast development of natural language processing methods enable new research directions in geospatial semantics. This article, therefore, provides a systematic review on the existing geospatial semantic research. Six major research areas are identified and discussed, including semantic interoperability, digital gazetteers, geographic information retrieval, geospatial Semantic Web, place semantics, and cognitive geographic concepts.}

abstract = {Context
Job rotation has been proposed as a managerial practice to be applied in the organizational environment to reduce job monotony, boredom, and exhaustion resulting from job simplification, specialization, and repetition. The scientific literature distinguishes between job-to-job and project-to-project rotations. Despite the potential benefits and its actual use on behalf of software companies, we do not have an accumulated body of scientific knowledge about benefits and limitations of job rotation in software engineering practice. In particular, we have no concrete empirical evidence about the use of project-to-project rotations in practice.
Goal
We aim to identify and discuss evidence about project-to-project (P2P) job rotation, in order to understand the potential benefits and limitations of this practice in software organizations.
Method
We deployed a mix-method research strategy to collect and analyze empirical evidence from the scientific literature, performing a systematic literature review, on one hand and from industrial practice, performing qualitative case studies on the other. We synthesized the evidence using techniques from meta-ethnography.
Results
We found eight benefits, nine limitations, and two factors classified as both benefits and limitations of P2P rotations in software engineering. Different research methods yielded confirmatory and complementary evidence, emphasizing the importance of conducting mix-method research. We found no contradictory evidence and five factors were identified in more than one study using different research methods, contributing to the strength of the evidence.
Conclusion
We synthesized evidence from multiple sources and used different research methods concerning the benefits and limitations of P2P rotation in software engineering practice. Our findings show that rotation tends to benefit important job outcomes, such as motivation, and to decrease job monotony. The main limitations were associated with the potential increase in intra-group social conflicts, individual cognitive effort, and workload, and a temporary decrease in productivity.}

It can also influence negatively the profits of the business or the organization, as the literature reveals. Mindfulness-based interventions have proven to be useful for ameliorating some aspects of burnout. By the same token, some agent-based simulator (ABSs) have been useful for predicting the influence of mindfulness programs on meditators in different aspects such as their emotions and their heart rate variability. In this context, the current work presents a novel ABS application that simulates the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on the job burnout subscales known as emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment, exhaustion in general, and disengagement from work. This application allows users to define mindfulness programs without needing any computer-science technical knowledge and simulates its influence on a group of practitioners with certain features. The simulator has been tested by simulating two mindfulness-based interventions of two scenarios reported in the literature. The ABS received input from the pre-intervention burnout measures, and performed 1000 simulations for each scenario for avoiding bias from the nondeterministic behavior. The simulated outcomes referring to the post-intervention burnout measures were similar to the real ones. The mean differences, mean squared errors and mean absolute error were below 0.4% in the normalized values of all the burnout subscales reported in the two scenarios. The source code of this ABS is publicly available for guaranteeing reproducibility and allowing other researchers to extend it or reuse some of its components.}

In this paper, a model of office space arrangement for the needs of teams using the Agile methodology is proposed. The main aim of the model is to support Scrum Teams in carrying out project tasks in a more efficient and effective way. The conceptual model is based on requirements that should be fulfilled by offices destined to have Agile (Scrum) working teams and can be adopted in any organization.

abstract = {The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act 2018 is Australia's latest attempt at solving the ‘going dark’ debate. Yet, like many other regulatory attempts towards ameliorating the ill-effects of encrypted communications and information, it has been criticised for privileging law enforcement and intelligence aims of public safety and security over other interests; particularly privacy and cybersecurity. Some fear that the new powers facilitate the creation of encryption backdoors that could be exploited by bad actors. This paper examines the so-called ‘systemic weakness’ limitation, which was designed to allay these fears. The paper concludes that the limitation is effective at preventing the most blatant, wholesale encryption backdoors, yet is not a panacea against all cybersecurity-related concerns that the instrument brings, and its efficacy in practice is likely to be undermined by its substantive and procedural complexity.}

We designed, implemented and assessed the Spring-a-story web app with 35 children aged 3 to 6 in a socio-economically-disadvantaged area in the UK. We sought to comprehend to what extent the application supports children in creating a narrative, and which type of prompts (basic dialogic reading and theory of mind prompts) better support their meaningful responses. Initial findings suggest how children were able to respond meaningfully to prompts and reported high levels of enjoyment of the activity. Furthermore, theory of mind prompts resulted in a marginally higher percentage of meaningful responses and theory of mind language compared to basic dialogic reading prompts. Study outcomes helped to delineate the design space that we shaped into six design challenges that aim to inform the community and guide the future design of tools to support children in independent dialogic reading of wordless picture e-books.}

Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.}

Method
Interviews were conducted with staff from residential aged care and logistics/transport organisations in Australia. Transcripts were analysed using a worker-centred systems framework.
Results and conclusions
Many barriers to more effective risk management were identified. Most fundamentally, few people knew of the need to manage MSD risk arising from work-related psychosocial hazards, and OHS-related skills of key managers were often reported as inadequate, particularly concerning management of risk from psychosocial hazards. Also, funding and staffing levels were often reported as problematic, and OHS issues were seen as lower priority than accreditation and commercial requirements.}

Using data collected from a survey of 1,650 citizen users living in one direct-controlled municipality and four high-population cities in China, this study verifies the components of e-government service quality through partial least squares (PLS) analysis and then tests the proposed concept model using structural equation modeling. The results reveal that the concept of e-government service quality has eight contributing dimensions: system quality, reliability, security, accessibility, information quality, service capability, interactivity, and responsiveness. Perceived service value is a powerful mediator between service quality and citizens’ continuous-use intention. The intention to use is a consequence of service quality, service value, and satisfaction.}

Today, the visibility of technological innovations has become essential to achieve the targeted market. It is now very difficult for a product manufacturer to reach customers without owning a website that is visible on search engine results pages. The goal of this paper is to build information channels between a company and its customers through improving both a company’s content of information on the Web and its website rank on the Internet through search engine results pages. Company information and knowledge are distributed through multiple stakeholders. The problem of building information channels between a company and customers is solved through a collaborative and distributed approach, on the one hand, and is supported by decision-making tools, on the other hand. The paper proposes an engineering model for building information channels and improving the visibility of the company on the Web. Agents are used for the implementation of the approach. The proposed model and its implementation handle the requirements, constraints, functions and solutions for improving Web visibility. The prototype tool, called CAWIS (Computer Aided Web Information Sharing), examines Web visibility in real time and evaluates the performance of the proposed content of information. CAWIS allows an exploratory and open way for building information channels and improving the visibility of product manufacturers on the Web.}

abstract = {Background and objective: In the 21st century, e-health is proving to be one of the strongest drivers for the global transformation of the health care industry. Health information is currently truly ubiquitous and widespread, but in order to guarantee that everyone can appropriately access and understand this information, regardless of their origin, it is essential to bridge the international gap. The diversity of health information seekers languages and cultures signifies that e-health applications must be adapted to satisfy their needs. Methods: In order to achieve this objective, current and future e-health programs should take into account the internationalization aspects. This paper presents an internationalization requirements specification in the form of a reusable requirements catalog, obtained from the principal related standards, and describes the key methodological elements needed to perform an e-health software audit by using the internationalization knowledge previously gathered. Results: S Health, a relevant, well-known Android application that has more than 150 million users in over 130 countries, was selected as a target for the e-health internationalization audit method and requirements specification presented above. This application example helped us to put into practice the proposal and show that the procedure is realistic and effective. Conclusions: The approach presented in this study is subject to continuous improvement through the incorporation of new knowledge originating from additional information sources, such as other standards or stakeholders. The application example is useful for early evaluation and serves to assess the applicability of the internationalization catalog and audit methodology, and to improve them. It would be advisable to develop of an automated tool with which to carry out the audit method.}

Nevertheless, with the inherently heterogeneous and dynamic property of multiple tasks, we inevitably face several challenges, such as the implementation feasibility, when dealing with the growing number of new tasks of interest. For this reason, in this study, we endeavour to shed some fresh light on shifting the conventional isolated affective computing into a lifelong learning paradigm, namely continual affective computing. As the first tentative work in audio and video domains, we explore the lifelong learning algorithm of elastic weight consolidation for this benchmark work, in an application of well-established audiovisual emotion recognition in a cross-culture scenario, i.e., French and German emotion recognition. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the introduced lifelong learning, we perform extensive experiments across the RECOLA and SEWA databases. The empirical results show that the implemented lifelong learning approach remarkably outperforms other baselines in most cases, and is even competitive to the joint training process in some cases, indicating its capability when handling the sequential learning process with multiple tasks.}

Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) may play an important role in bringing about changes in attitude and behavior because they potentially allow tailored but anonymous, free and convenient access and can deliver the information in a conversational way that overcomes health literacy barriers. In this first study we compare the use of an ECA with a video to deliver two strategies (education and contact) to address stigma around the mental health condition of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Our results with 245 participants show that both media (ECA and video) aided recognition of AN and produced significant changes in positive volitional stigma and negative volitional stigma but not in traditional stigma (desire for social distance), with some notable differences based on gender. Baseline data was used in place of a control group and the sample population was undergraduate Psychology students due to higher incidences of AN in this population. Further validation is needed involving a control group and testing on populations other than Psychology students. Nevertheless, these initial results encourage our future work to build tailored ECAs to challenge particular beliefs to support a wide range of educational interventions to change behaviors and improve decision-making relating to health and wellbeing.}

Geographically distributed work in project-oriented software development courses is both demanding and rewarding for student teams, who are susceptible to various risks stemming from different internal and external factors, being the sources of stress and impacting team performance. Objective: In this paper, we analyze the resilience of teams of students working in a geographically fully distributed setting. Resilience is analyzed in relation to two representative stress factors: non-contributing team members and changes to customer project requirements. We also reason on team collaboration patterns and analyze potential dependencies among these collaboration patterns, team resilience and stress factors. Method: We conduct a longitudinal case-study over five years on our Distributed Software Development (DSD) course. Based on empirical data, we study team resilience to two stress factors by observing their impact on process and product quality aspects of team performance. The same performance aspects are studied for identified collaboration patterns, and bidirectional influence between patterns and resilience is investigated. Results: Teams with up to two non-contributing members experience graceful degradation of performance indicators. A large number of non-contributing students almost guarantees the occurrence of educationally undesirable collaboration patterns. Exposed to requirements change stress, less resilient teams tend to focus on delivering the functional product rather than retaining a proper development process. Conclusions: Practical recommendations to be applied in contexts similar to our case have been provided at the end of the study. They include suggestions to mitigate the sources of stress, for example, by careful planning the team organization and balancing the number of regular and exchange students, or by discussing the issue of changing requirements with the external customers before the start of the project.}

Evacuation experiments were conducted in an immersive virtual metro station, in which each participant was presented with one of three different patterns of crowd flow and asked to complete an evacuation task. The patterns of crowd flow were represented by non-player characters that split differently at each wayfinding decision point in the metro station. The experiments were conducted in Beijing, Los Angeles and London. The results showed that uneven splits of crowd flow motivated participants under mental stress to follow the majority of the crowd. This influence of crowd flow was generally consistent over the course of evacuation, and such consistency could be reinforced by stronger directional information conveyed by the crowd flow as well as positive feedback from the outcomes of previous wayfinding decisions. The results also indicated that the influence of crowd flow was significant in all three cultures represented by the three cities, however, the impact of culture on how participants would respond to the directional information conveyed by the crowd flow was insignificant.}

abstract = {Hate speech is an increasingly important societal issue in the era of digital communication. Hateful expressions often make use of figurative language and, although they represent, in some sense, the dark side of language, they are also often prime examples of creative use of language. While hate speech is a global phenomenon, current studies on automatic hate speech detection are typically framed in a monolingual setting. In this work, we explore hate speech detection in low-resource languages by transferring knowledge from a resource-rich language, English, in a zero-shot learning fashion. We experiment with traditional and recent neural architectures, and propose two joint-learning models, using different multilingual language representations to transfer knowledge between pairs of languages. We also evaluate the impact of additional knowledge in our experiment, by incorporating information from a multilingual lexicon of abusive words. The results show that our joint-learning models achieve the best performance on most languages. However, a simple approach that uses machine translation and a pre-trained English language model achieves a robust performance. In contrast, Multilingual BERT fails to obtain a good performance in cross-lingual hate speech detection. We also experimentally found that the external knowledge from a multilingual abusive lexicon is able to improve the models’ performance, specifically in detecting the positive class. The results of our experimental evaluation highlight a number of challenges and issues in this particular task. One of the main challenges is related to the issue of current benchmarks for hate speech detection, in particular how bias related to the topical focus in the datasets influences the classification performance. The insufficient ability of current multilingual language models to transfer knowledge between languages in the specific hate speech detection task also remain an open problem. However, our experimental evaluation and our qualitative analysis show how the explicit integration of linguistic knowledge from a structured abusive language lexicon helps to alleviate this issue.}
