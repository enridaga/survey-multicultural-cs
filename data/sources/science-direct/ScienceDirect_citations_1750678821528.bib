abstract = {This chapter considers the political economic or meta-determinants of health for the global public health ecosystem, critical for the scale, scope, and speed of coordinated actions (including in consensus-based governance and financing) to generate equitable and effective global health solutions to urgent shared challenges. Rising international separation and tensions between democracies and autocracies in addition to the Global North and the Global South undermines the health of these regimes and regions and that of humanity. This chapter thus considers global health and artificial intelligence (AI) in their political economic context in the strategic competition of dominant power players, particularly with the governments, militaries, and corporations of the United States and China which account for most of the global health financing and programs along with that of AI’s development and deployment. Failures in managed strategic competition can not only undermine the cooperation required for the AI-driven global public health ecosystem, but they may even imperil it through accelerated and even catastrophic conflicts. This chapter therefore considers the history and foreseeable future of the global public health ecosystem from the structural perspective of political economics, including the underlying values that may provide a durable foundation for coordinated health action. It additionally considers emergent solutions and advances for the health ecosystem toward this including with human security and data sovereignty within Political Liberalism articulating a bridge between the above blocs, while addressing health determinants integrally and globally: social determinants of health, political determinants of health, economic determinants of health, commercial determinants of health, and digital determinants of health. Specific advances include shared global governance, affordable clean energy transition, and affordable AI digital transformation for sustainable development (with deference and deterrence guardrails maximizing cooperation, managing strategic competition, and minimizing conflict). The chapter additionally considers medical diplomacy, multilateral development, deep medicine, large language models (including ChatGPT), commercial fusion, and digital supply chain resilience (with diversification and de-risking), in the context of moving away from an imperial ideological values-driven ruler-based world order to a more sovereign integral values-driven rules-based world order.}

abstract = {The aim of this doctrinal legal study is to analyze the interplay between the vulnerability of groups in algorithmic systems and the protection of collective interests in data protection law in Brazil's legal system. Two research questions are raised: (i) Is the protection of personal data regulation applicable to data processing activities related to algorithmic groups? and (ii) can algorithmic groups be regarded as groups with vulnerability under the LGPD legal regime? This article is divided into three parts apart from the introduction, and combines three strands of research, namely group rights theory, vulnerability studies, and law and technology perspective. This combination is key to outline, in Sections 2 and 3, a theoretical framework that elucidates the concepts of collective data protection and group vulnerability mapping both onto the notion of algorithmic groups. Section 2 argues for the collective dimension of the right to the protection of personal data as the foundation of a collective data protection. Section 3, in turn, explores the conceptualization of group vulnerability and how this discourse resonates with algorithmic groups in the onlife world. I draw on vulnerability studies, and on Mireille Hildebrandt's law and technology perspective to delineate what do I mean by group vulnerability and how do I articulate theoretically this notion with algorithmic groups and the affordances of algorithmic systems. Section 4 examines the relation between collective data protection and vulnerability of algorithmic groups under the data protection legal framework in Brazil. To answer the research questions, the analysis is concentrated on three aspects of Brazilian data protection law: (i) the “collectivization of data protection”; (ii) the integration of group vulnerability in the data protection legal framework; (iii) data protection impact assessments in the context of LGPD's risk-based approach. The collective dimension of the right to personal data protection is increasingly recognized in Brazilian law through class-action litigation, particularly in the context of addressing vulnerabilities caused by new data-driven technologies. This collective dimension should guide courts and the Brazilian DPA in interpreting and applying the LGPD, especially Art. 12, § 2, regarding group data processing by algorithmic profiling systems. Data protection law in Brazil acknowledges that groups of data subjects may face vulnerability, requiring special protection and safeguards to mitigate risks and violations. Group vulnerability signals contexts deserving special attention and serves as a source of obligations and rights. Within LGPD's risk-based approach, mandatory DPIAs in ML-based algorithmic profiling systems help identify vulnerable groups and implement appropriate safeguards to mitigate risks of harm or rights violations. Non-compliance with safeguard implementation obligations should be considered a breach of Brazilian data protection laws.}

abstract = {Differential evolution (DE) is one of the most popular paradigms of evolutionary algorithms. In general, DE does not exploit distribution information provided by the population and, as a result, its search performance is limited. In this paper, cumulative population distribution information of DE has been utilized to establish an Eigen coordinate system by making use of covariance matrix adaptation. The crossover operator of DE implemented in the Eigen coordinate system has the capability to identify the features of the fitness landscape. Furthermore, we propose a cumulative population distribution information based DE framework called CPI-DE. In CPI-DE, for each target vector, two trial vectors are generated based on both the original coordinate system and the Eigen coordinate system. Then, the target vector is compared with these two trial vectors and the best one will survive into the next generation. CPI-DE has been applied to two classic versions of DE and three state-of-the-art variants of DE for solving two sets of benchmark test functions, namely, 28 test functions with 30 and 50 dimensions at the 2013 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, and 30 test functions with 30 and 50 dimensions at the 2014 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation. The experimental results suggest that CPI-DE is an effective framework to enhance the performance of DE.}

abstract = {Differential evolution (DE) is a simple, yet very effective, population-based search technique. However, it is challenging to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation behaviors of the DE algorithm. In this paper, we boost the population diversity while preserving simplicity by introducing a multi-population DE to solve large-scale global optimization problems. In the proposed algorithm, called mDE-bES, the population is divided into independent subgroups, each with different mutation and update strategies. A novel mutation strategy that uses information from either the best individual or a randomly selected one is used to produce quality solutions to balance exploration and exploitation. Selection of individuals for some of the tested mutation strategies utilizes fitness-based ranks of these individuals. Function evaluations are divided into epochs. At the end of each epoch, individuals between the subgroups are exchanged to facilitate information exchange at a slow pace. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on a set of 19 large-scale continuous optimization problems. A comparative study is carried out with other state-of-the-art optimization techniques. The results show that mDE-bES has a competitive performance and scalability behavior compared to the contestant algorithms.}

abstract = {ICT projects are considered an important means of achieving development goals in developing countries. Although voluminous, the research to date is inconsistent in theorizing how, or why, development outcomes do or do not occur following the introduction of ICT4D. To better understand how and why ICT projects succeed, and even what success means in the ICT4D context, we conducted a literature review of ICT4D studies published during the period 2000–2016. We find that the very meaning of development varies, with four meanings of development emerging from the literature: (1) development as increased freedom, (2) development as expanded inclusion, (3) development as increased economic productivity, and (4) development as improved well-being. An ICT might succeed according to one meaning of development while simultaneously hindering achievement according to another meaning. As revealed by our analysis of the literature, these four perspectives suffer from some limitations, not least among them being the imposition of colonialist views of development on the recipients of the ICT4D. To address the limitations, we employ postcolonial theory to derive a new theory of ICT4D in which development is defined as an increase in power parity between dominant stakeholders and intended beneficiaries.}
