abstract = {Research on information and communication technology (ICT) innovation highlights its crucial role in fostering socioeconomic development in underdeveloped regions. Prior studies have shown that the unique context of these regions can present significant challenges, which often lead to project failure. These studies generally examined the phenomenon at the organizational and societal levels, offering limited insights at the individual level, especially on how challenges are dealt with by entrepreneurs. By analyzing two ICT innovation projects in Bangladesh, we explore how entrepreneurs appropriate these challenges and suggest innovative solutions to achieve desired project outcomes. Drawing on the concept of “liminality,” we develop a process model that depicts how entrepreneurs adapt to contextual challenges and establish contextualized practices for successful ICT innovations. We discuss the strategies used by entrepreneurs for path creation during this process and highlight the importance of digital technologies in supporting these strategies. We then outline the implications of our findings for research on ICT innovation in underdeveloped regions.}

However, cultural differences can be a barrier to technology-transfer and they influence all aspects of individuals' behavior. In this regard, cultural intelligence (CQ) enables individuals to deal more effectively with these differences, and those with a high CQ are more adaptable and able to cope in cultural environments other than their own. The aim of the present study is to propose and validate a model in which CQ is an antecedent of satisfaction with the travel app and with the tourism experience. Based on a sample of 243 Spanish tourists who used a travel app on their trip, the study finds that a tourist's CQ influences their satisfaction both with the app and with the tourism experience. It further demonstrates the influence of satisfaction with the travel app on satisfaction with the tourism experience. This research holds a series of implications of significant interest both for scholars and professionals in the tourism industry.}

Serious games have proved to be effective and highly motivational educational tools capable of increasing awareness, changing behaviour, reduce risk factors and even improving protective skills. This paper presents a novel approach of using both participatory design and gameplay to sensitize children (aged 7–12​ years old) on bullying victimization. Action research strategy is used with intentions to improve the quality of school life in Japan through the use of a serious game called Shimpai Muyou. What makes it stand out from the rest of the crowd is that the entire intervention was design, developed and evaluated through partnering with children in a school setting. The research is largely qualitative and exploratory in nature, stemmed from interdisciplinary core ideas related to technology, education, psychology and interactive theatre. Findings from both formative and summative evaluations indicated that child-users empathically engaged with the synthetic characters, attributing a range of emotions to their actions e.g., empathy, compassion, sadness, anger etc., tackling ethical dilemmas and bullying situations with confidence. From these results, we can conclude that Shimpai Muyou is a useful and engaging school-based anti-bullying intervention.}

In the healthcare and biomedical research domain, applications depending on electronic health records (EHRs) identify privacy preservation as a major concern. Existing solutions cannot always satisfy the evolving research demands such as linking patient records across organizational boundaries due to the potential for patient re-identification. In this work, we show how semantic methods can be applied to support the formulation and enforcement of access control policy whilst ensuring that privacy leakage can be detected and prevented. The work is illustrated through a case study associated with the Australasian Diabetes Data Network (ADDN – www.addn.org.au), the national paediatric type-1 diabetes data registry, and the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN – www.aurin.org.au) platform that supports Australia-wide access to urban and built environment data sets. We demonstrate that through extending the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) with semantic capabilities, finer-grained access control encompassing data risk disclosure mechanisms can be supported. We discuss the contributions that can be made using this approach to socio-economic development and political management within business systems, and especially those situations where secure data access and data linkage is required.}

abstract = {Decision-making processes are significantly influenced by internal social network interactions and external information inputs. While previous research has highlighted the role of social networks in opinion evolution, the dynamics of information dissemination and its interaction with these networks are less understood. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Social-Information-Opinion Dynamic Supernetwork (SIO-DS) model, which integrates critical factors such as the impact of external information and opinion propagation, alongside the influence of internal social network structures and individual willingness to adjust opinions. This model takes into account the varied levels of confidence and individualized dynamic influence among decision makers, recognizing both their asymmetry and diversity. It performs opinion dynamics using bounded confidence models and parameters that govern information dissemination. We found that scale-free networks, which feature influential leaders, are more effective at reaching consensus compared to small-world networks, which are hindered by limited inter-group connections. The speed of information dissemination is critical; moderate speeds help in maintaining a stable consensus by balancing social influence, while very fast or slow speeds risk exacerbating polarization based on how social influence is managed. The SIO-DS model has broad implications for enhancing decision-making in corporate management by optimizing network structures, in public policy by managing public opinion, and in crisis management by developing effective communication strategies. Ultimately, this model not only deepens our understanding of opinion dynamics but also provides practical tools for improving decision-making quality and efficiency in various contexts.}

abstract = {One main asset of Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) lies in its centralized architecture that allows network operators to serve dynamic flows of mobile traffic with efficient utilization of baseband resources and lesser operation costs than the distributed RAN architecture. For this very reason, the implementation of online resource allocation algorithms in the BaseBand Unit (BBU) pool for handling loads of multiple Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) is one of the most motivating challenges in C-RAN. Those centralized algorithms must be able to handle efficiently interference between users, as well as to dynamically select RRHs that can be turned on/off based on traffic variation. By doing so, the total RRHs transmission power can be minimized and the number of active BBUs within the cloud can also be reduced. In this paper, the issues of dynamic wireless resource allocation, transmission power minimization and BBU-RRH assignment in downlink C-RAN are addressed in one framework. We have previously attempted to address these problems by proposing a approach based on the branch-and-cut algorithm to solve small instances of the problem to optimality. However, due to the combinatorial complexity of the problem, finding optimal solutions for a large-scale network may take a fair amount of time and will not be suitable for online optimization. Towards this end, we propose a novel two-stage approach to address these issues for a large-scale problem. The first stage is a new proposal that addresses the problems of dynamic resource allocation and power minimization in C-RAN using a simulated annealing approach with a specific neighborhood search program. The BBU-RRH assignment is handled in the second stage using a multiple knapsack formulation. Through extensive event-based simulations, our proposal achieves significant reduction in time complexity and yields near optimal performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.}

In the presented work the radio frequency identification (RFID) system is used to access information from passive primary receiver (PURx). This inspires to develop a novel sensing algorithm along with PURx protection from harmful transmissions of cognitive radio (CR) nodes in CR network. The novelty in the sensing and protection lies in the approach of accessing information from primary users. Here a CR node can detect occupancy of primary channel from both, primary transmitter (PUTx) end as well as from PURx end on the basis of relative distance. For protection of PURx a novel power control algorithm is proposed and implemented. The results indicate less energy is needed to run the network along with a notable improvement in average throughput and reduction in delay for increasing amount of CR traffic.}

However, challenges remain in assessing their psychological properties, particularly regarding prompt design, comparison with human data, and the ability to simulate real-world psychological differences across cultural groups. This study investigates how LLMs respond to personality assessments and cultural variables, addressing gaps in previous research. In three studies, we explored the impact of model parameters and prompt variations on LLM responses to personality tests. Study 1 examined how temperature, model type, and prompt templates influenced LLM responses, revealing that while temperature settings had minimal impact, prompt variations led to significant differences. Study 2 compared LLMs' self-report personality scores with human data (N = 18,192–49,159), finding that LLMs scored higher in positive traits (e.g., extroversion) and lower in negative traits (e.g., psychopathy), reflecting their training biases. Study 3 tested LLMs’ ability to simulate cultural differences by assessing virtual subjects from China and the USA. While significant differences were observed between the groups, both demonstrated East Asian self-construal patterns, indicating limitations in simulating authentic cultural psychological differences. These findings highlight the influence of prompt design on LLM responses, the divergence between LLM and human personality profiles, and the difficulty of simulating accurate cultural psychological differences. These results underscore the need for more refined methodologies in psychological simulations using LLMs and suggest that current models struggle to represent diverse human psychological traits accurately.}

JeanetteWing’s seminal work on Computational Thinking (CT) is an important landmark for this goal: CT represents a way of thinking, a set of problem-solving skills which can be valuable when interacting with digital technologies, and with different fields of knowledge, such as Arts and Humanities. Even if this cross-areas relevance has been celebrated and acknowledged in theoretical research, there has been a lack of practical projects exploring these links between CT and non-STEM fields. This research develops these links. We present a specific case – a game produced by two 14 years-old boys – within Playing Beowulf, a collaboration with the British library’s Young Researchers programme, in which students aged 13–14 from an inner-London (UK) school have developed games based on their own readings of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf during an after-school club. The game was produced using MissionMaker, a software (currently under development at UCL Knowledge Lab) that allows users to create and code their own first-person 3D games in a simple way, using pre-made 3D assets, such as rooms, props, characters and weapons and a simplified programming language manipulated through drop-down lists. We argue that MissionMaker, by simplifying the development process (low floor), can be a means to foster the building of knowledge in both STEM (CT) and Arts and Humanities, building bridges between these two areas inside and outside traditional schooling.}

Among the participants, 20 completed both the pre-test and the post-test and 16 attended the focus group interviews. The design of the training course was based on constructs informed by the diffusion of innovation theory and the technology acceptance model, and it incorporated both a classroom-based and small group tutoring approach.

Its primary intention is to look into the acquisition of L2, particularly English as a second language (ESL) in the younger generation, i.e., Generation Z of current university students. It also attempts to highlight both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in L2 acquisition and therefore to highlight future strategies regarding FLL in university education. The current research in this area provides us with overtly optimistic results in FLL with the assistance of social media, however, the paper claims that the situation of utilizing social media in FLL needs further investigation and analysis, mainly from the psycholinguistic point of view.

However, one of the main challenges remains the accurate transmission of complex and negative emotions, such as anger or sadness, due to the difficulty of correctly capturing the facial micro gestures that characterize these emotions. Traditional GAN architectures, such as StyleGAN and DCGAN, have proven highly effective in synthesizing positive emotions such as joy. However, they have limitations regarding more subtle emotions, leading to a higher rate of false negatives. In response to this problem, we propose fine-tuning the GAN discriminator. This tuning optimizes the discriminator’s ability to identify the minor details in facial expressions by using perceptual losses, allowing for better differentiation between the generated emotions, reducing classification errors, and improving precision in difficult-to-represent emotions. The results obtained in this study demonstrate a significant improvement in the system’s precision, especially in complex emotions. Precision for the anger emotion increased from 85.7% to 89.1%, and the number of false negatives was reduced from 16 to 10. Overall, precision for complex emotions exceeded 85%, substantially improving traditional solutions. These results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuning the GAN architecture for applications requiring more faithful and effective emotional interaction, significantly improving user experience across multiple domains.}

Backsourcing is the process of insourcing previously outsourced activities. Backsourcing can be a viable alternative when companies experience environmental or strategic changes, or challenges with outsourcing. While outsourcing and related processes have been extensively studied, few studies report experiences with backsourcing.
Objectives:
We summarize the results of the research literature on backsourcing of IT, with a focus on software development. By identifying practically relevant experience, we present findings that may help companies considering backsourcing. In addition, we identify gaps in the current research literature and point out areas for future work.
Method:
Our systematic literature review (SLR) started with a search for empirical studies on the backsourcing of IT. From each study, we identified the context in which backsourcing occurred, the factors leading to the decision, the backsourcing process, and the outcomes of backsourcing. We employed inductive coding to extract textual data from the papers and qualitative cross-case analysis to synthesize the evidence.
Results:
We identified 17 papers that reported 26 cases of backsourcing, six of which were related to software development. The cases came from a variety of contexts. The most common reasons for backsourcing were improving quality, reducing costs, and regaining control of outsourced activities. We model the backsourcing process as containing five sub-processes: change management, vendor relationship management, competence building, organizational build-up, and transfer of ownership. We identified 14 positive outcomes and nine negative outcomes of backsourcing. We also aggregated the evidence and detailed three relationships of potential use to companies considering backsourcing. Finally, we have highlighted the knowledge areas of software engineering associated with the backsourcing of software development.
Conclusion:
The backsourcing of IT is a complex process; its implementation depends on the prior outsourcing relationship and other contextual factors. Our systematic literature review contributes to a better understanding of this process by identifying its components and their relationships based on the peer-reviewed literature. Our results can serve as a motivation and baseline for further research on backsourcing and provide guidelines and process fragments from which practitioners can benefit when they engage in backsourcing.}

abstract = {Background
Social networking services (SNSs) are recognized to be a promising approach to easily deliver health interventions and to enhance social support for exercise adherence. However, the patterns and aspects of social support through SNSs have not been reported and their influence on other social-cognitive factors remains inconclusive.
Objective
Our objective is to explore how social support delivered through SNSs impacts interactions among Korean-Chinese (KC) middle-aged women and to identify how this approach influences social-cognitive factors for exercise (eg, sense of community, self-efficacy for exercise, and social support for exercise).
Methods
A mixed methods design was used. Text analysis of SNS messages and text mining using the Korean Natural Language Application (KoALA) were conducted. Social-cognitive factors (eg, sense of community, self-efficacy for exercise, and social support for exercise) were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks using a structured questionnaire. A comparison of social-cognitive factors at baseline and at 12 weeks was conducted to identify any potential significant changes, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results
A total of 259 SNS messages were collected from 24 KC women, distributed among four chat groups, who participated in a 12-week walking intervention program between August and October 2018. The individual average frequency of chatting via the SNS was 10.79 (range 0-34) and the most frequent type of social support through the SNS was network support (172/259, 66.4%). The most common words extracted from the SNS were Health, Exercise, Participation, and We. Overall, the perceived levels of sense of community (P<.001) and social support for exercise (P=.002) were significantly increased at 12 weeks compared with baseline. Group 1 (P=.03) and Group 4 (P=.03), whose members demonstrated the highest frequency of network support, experienced a significant increase only in the level of sense of community.
Conclusions
By integrating these data and conducting a mixed methods analysis, we observed that among the types of social support, network support was a key point for the promotion of social-cognitive factors in increasing exercise adherence. Therefore, network support through SNS-based interventions should be considered as a useful strategy to help vulnerable migrant populations make changes to exercise behaviors.}

The present research takes a bibliographic approach to shed light on current research on AR in human-computer interaction and, using topic modeling, to identify and classify the topics that have drawn researchers’ interest. The results reveal three major topics of interest to researchers, namely “Education, Learning & Training Research”, “Marketing, Consumer Behavior & Business Research”, and “Digital Tourism & Cultural Heritage Research”. Drawing upon co-authorship theory, we identify prominent AR expert co-authorship networks that work on similar topics, yet also highlight that AR research is concentrated in a few research groups that publish articles with similar groups of authors and little outside their own networks. Together with AR experts from the four largest co-authorship networks, we highlight the common challenges that emerge in AR research, suggest solutions, and jointly propose a research agenda for AR and human behavior research.}

Given the recent rise in online hate targeting immigrants, this study examines factors that bring individuals into virtual contact with such material. Utilizing recently collected online survey data of American youth and young adults, we draw on insights from Routine Activity Theory and Social Structure-Social Learning Theory to understand exposure to anti-immigrant online hate material. Specifically, we consider how online routines, location in social structure, and social identity are associated with exposure. Results indicate that engaging in behaviors that can increase proximity to motivated offenders increases the likelihood of being exposed to anti-immigrant hate, as does engaging in online behaviors that bolster one's target suitability. Additionally, individuals who view Americanism as fundamental to their social identity are more apt to encounter anti-immigrant hate material on the Internet, as are those who are more dissatisfied with the current direction of the country.}

In explaining the rollout of these networks, the paper derives from the literature a geographical model on broadband provision and examines it empirically by focusing on the spatial and temporal effects driving very high capacity fibre-based network development in the Netherlands. The paper confirms previous research on market uncertainty and the techno-economics of broadband development, but shows, in addition, that more specific factors related to local effects and demand uncertainty are vital in explaining the rollout of very high capacity fibre-based network.}

We designed an evaluation index system that includes the six dimensions of population, economy, society, government, environment, and external links by integrating multiple sets of heterogeneous data, and applied it to cities in the Yangtze River Delta. The results show that Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou have the highest vitality levels but are weak regarding their eco-environments. Cities with high vitality are distributed on the Z-shaped key development belt of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration planning. Regional differences in external links and population vitality are significant, and these two dimensions pose weaknesses to many cities. The interregional differences linked to social vitality are the smallest. Vitality not only comes from within the urban system, but also greatly depends on the external environment. The concept “vital triangle” and relevant evaluation framework are intended to serve as a basis for future research, and the case study could provide some key decision-making support for urban planning and management.}

As user research teams and organizations have become more common, it has become a larger problem to communicate insight from the user research to the whole product team, so that everyone can see what matters. Contextual Design has always used models of the user to communicate; with Contextual Design 2.0, we've expanded those models to communicate the aspects of design that matter for today's highly connected technology.

The current literature is very extensive and covers a wide variety of deterministic and stochastic models. However, with the increase in computing resources, new, more general, and flexible procedures based on simulation models can assess the effectiveness of measures and quantify the current state of the epidemic. This paper illustrates the potential of this approach to build a new dynamic probabilistic model to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in different compartments. Methods: We propose a new probabilistic model in which, for the first time in the epidemic literature, parameter learning is carried out using gradient-free stochastic black-box optimization techniques simulating multiple trajectories of the infection dynamics in a general way, solving an inverse problem that is defined employing the daily information from mortality records. Results: After the application of the new proposal in Spain in the first and successive waves, the result of the model confirms the accuracy to estimate the seroprevalence and allows us to know the real dynamics of the pandemic a posteriori to assess the impact of epidemiological measures by the Spanish government and to plan more efficiently the subsequent decisions with the prior knowledge obtained. Conclusions:The model results allow us to estimate the daily patterns of COVID-19 infections in Spain retrospectively and examine the population’s exposure to the virus dynamically in contrast to seroprevalence surveys. Furthermore, given the flexibility of our simulation framework, we can model situations —even using non-parametric distributions between the different compartments in the model— that other models in the existing literature cannot. Our general optimization strategy remains valid in these cases, and we can easily create other non-standard simulation epidemic models that incorporate more complex and dynamic structures.}

abstract = {Background
Previous studies have identified that the effective management of cyber security in large health care environments is likely to be significantly impacted by human and social factors, as well as by technical controls. However, there have been limited attempts to confirm this by using measured and integrated studies to identify specific user motivations and behaviors that can be managed to achieve improved outcomes.
Objective
This study aims to document and analyze survey and interview data from a diverse range of health care staff members, to determine the primary motivations and behaviors that influence their acceptance and application of cyber security messaging and controls. By identifying these issues, recommendations can be made to positively influence future cyber security governance in health care.
Methods
An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach was undertaken to analyze quantitative data from a web-based staff survey (N=103), with a concurrent qualitative investigation applied to data gathered via in-depth staff interviews (N=9). Data from both stages of this methodology were mapped to descriptive variables based on a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM; TAM2). After normalization, the quantitative data were verified and analyzed using descriptive statistics, distribution and linearity measures, and a bivariate correlation of the TAM variables to identify the Pearson coefficient (r) and significance (P) values. Finally, after confirming Cronbach α, the determinant score for multicollinearity, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure, and applying the Bartlett test of sphericity (χ2), an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify the primary factors with an eigenvalue (λ) >1.0. Comments captured during the qualitative interviews were coded using NVivo software (QSR International) to create an emic-to-etic understanding, which was subsequently integrated with the quantitative results to produce verified conclusions.
Results
Using the explanatory sequential methodology, this study showed that the perceived usefulness of security controls emerged as the most significant factor influencing staff beliefs and behaviors. This variable represented 24% of all the variances measured in the EFA and was also the most common category identified across all coded interviews (281/692, 40.6%). The word frequency analysis showed that systems, patients, and people represented the top 3 recurring themes reported by the interviewees.
Conclusions
To improve cyber security governance in large health care environments, efforts should be focused on demonstrating how confidentiality, integrity, availability, policies, and cloud or vendor-based controls (the main contributors of usefulness measured by the EFA) can directly improve outcomes for systems, staff, and patients. Further consideration also needs to be given to how clinicians should share data and collaborate on patient care, with tools and processes provided to support and manage data sharing securely and to achieve a consistent baseline of secure and normalized behaviors.}

abstract = {Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by high levels of blood glucose, which can lead over time to severe impairment to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, nerves and premature death. Diabetes is prone to complications such as kidney failure, vision loss and nerve damage. The total assessed cost of diagnosed diabetes is growing rapidly; hence, harnessing telehealth for diabetes management may be cost-effective. A few previous publications have pointed to the effectiveness of telehealth but more numerous articles indicate that the results are inconsistent and economic models are lacking. This narrative review surveys the recent literature on the implementation of telehealth for diabetes management that incorporates cost-effectiveness analyses.
Materials and methods
This paper follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [25].
Results
The vast majority of articles dealing with managing Type 2 diabetes have primarily used the telephone for telehealth monitoring (followed by teleophalmology and telemonitoring). Most publications report that the telehealth solution was cost effective. The leading cost-effectiveness method was the Markov model; however, only a small number of papers extend the Markov model to critical sensitivity analyses of their outcomes. The main goal of telehealth in general is diabetes management or monitoring, followed by ophthalmology, depression management, weight loss and other goals.
Conclusion
This work summarizes the literature on recent trends in telehealth options, and analyzes successes and failures in relation to both effectiveness and costs, which may be valuable to both scholars and practitioners.}

Our method combines multimodal features extracted from textual and visual components of the original video, along with contextual information from related videos. Text data is processed using word embedding techniques, while image and visual elements are analyzed through Convolutional Neural Networks. To evaluate our framework's robustness and generalizability, we conducted experiments on two complementary datasets: a publicly available multilingual dataset and a newly constructed Korean dataset. The results show that the proposed method achieves a 0.1–9.7 % improvement in detection accuracy compared to traditional content-only approaches. These findings underscore the value of leveraging related video information for more reliable fake news detection, and they confirm that our hybrid method can be effectively applied across diverse language and regional contexts. Our work contributes to mitigating the societal harm caused by misinformation on video-sharing platforms and offers practical insights into developing more robust multimedia fake news detection systems.}

abstract = {Purpose
Existing research infers that in the information systems (IS) and information technology (IT) fields, a shift may occur between technical and non-technical skills. However, relatively little research has focused on going changes in terms of key skills in the IS suppliers sector. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap by investigating these skills evolution in the IS suppliers domain and discusses their impacts on IS and IT curricula.
Design/methodology/approach
This paper uses a qualitative method based on 15 semi-structured face-to-face interviews, with highly dedicated operational managers in senior positions in the field.
Findings
This study identifies, for the IS suppliers, the critical skills, which are basically non-technical, and peripheral skills, which are primarily technical. It then considers the consequences of this change and the necessary adaptations it requires for businesses and training for this field.
Practical implications
The findings suggest the need to redesign the educational curricula for future managers, and the adaptations required to the work organization, human resource management and business models of firms in the field.
Originality/value
The paper’s value is twofold. First, it focuses on IS service suppliers, an understudied area (most research examines IS outsourcing from the customer’s standpoint); second, it reveals the shift away from technical toward non-technical skills in a field that is intrinsically technical – a change that may occur more slowly than in other less technical sectors – and the consequences of this change for firms, education and society.}

In order to identify the mechanism and specific circumstances of flaming, this study employed emotional contagion as the main theoretical framework and conducted a 2 (argument presented in a news article: support gun control vs. against gun control) × 2 (volume of negative comments: small vs. large) × 2 (news readers’ pre-existing beliefs: support gun control vs. against gun control) between-subjects experiment. Participants were asked to read an online news article about a gun-related topic as well as negative reader comments before they wrote a comment of their own. The experimental results showed that participants were more likely to use swear words in their comments when their viewpoint was diametrically opposed to the argument presented in the news article and when the article was accompanied by a low volume of negative comments. This interaction effect was mediated by negative emotions that participants experienced when reading the article and its associated comments. These findings have theoretical implications for future research pertaining to the identification of online circumstances and causes that could help mitigate the occurrence of flaming.}

This way, no hooks have to be inserted in the gamified system other than reporting of basic events happening within it. The proposed notation allows to design gamification rules that can be applied to different gamified systems, only provided they can generate event reports using the proposed representation (and belong to the same domain so that the rules remain relevant). It also simplifies building of rule-processing systems that serve various gamified systems. It is especially useful for complex gamification systems with multiple sources of rules and multiple points of their processing.}

The shortage of health professionals, rehabilitation therapists, nurses and doctors, and persons capable of taking care of the growing numbers of people with disabilities are major causes of this gap in healthcare. Evidence suggests that rehabilitation robots, which include therapeutic and assistive robots, can support neurorehabilitation of persons with neurological injuries and help bridge this care gap. Currently, the impact of rehabilitation robotics has not been inclusive, and access to the potential benefits of these technologies is unequal. Unfortunately, robot technology-assisted rehabilitation solutions are expensive, and as a result, they are primarily available in high-income countries (HICs). Solutions that are appropriate for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are rare and so their availability and impact in these countries are low. Given the potential of these solutions to bridge resource gaps, we must consider innovative ways to increase their inclusivity. This chapter raises general and ethical issues around access to rehabilitation robot technologies and discusses them in the context of inclusivity—a term that encompasses affordability and other common issues that may justify limiting or increasing use in low-resource settings in HICs and LMICs. We suggest that inclusivity can be increased if we address typical concerns and barriers to equal access for their rehabilitation use by diverse populations. The first section describes the motivation for this chapter. The second section briefly discusses these barriers from the lens of access, ethics—justice, privacy, safety, and autonomy; affordability; and finally, feasibility, usability, and acceptance. The third section details a potential practice framework for increasing inclusivity.}

Soft skills (e.g., communication) significantly contribute to software project success.
Objective:
We aim to understand (a) what are relevant soft skills in software engineering, (b) how soft skills relate to characteristics of hiring organizations, and (c) how reliably we can automatically identify soft skills in job adverts to support their continuous analysis. We focus on soft skills required by organizations in New Zealand, a country with a small but growing software sector characterized by a skills shortage, reliance on offshoring, and embedded in a bi-cultural context.
Method:
We manually analyzed 530 job adverts from New Zealand’s largest portal for technology-related positions. We identified soft skills following an inductive approach, i.e., without pre-defined soft skills. We complemented the manual analysis with an automated analysis using Flexiterm (an approach for term recognition).
Results:
We found explicit references to soft skills in 82% of adverts. Adverts from recruitment agencies (compared to hiring companies) included fewer soft skills. We identified 17 soft skills and proposed a contextualized software engineering description. Communication-related skills are most in demand. Soft skills related to broader human or societal values (e.g., empathy, cultural awareness) or distributed development are not common. Soft skills do not depend on company size or core business and domain of companies, or whether a company operates globally. Automatically identifying soft skills in adverts is error-prone.
Conclusions:
Employers explicitly ask for soft skills. Our findings support previous studies that highlight the importance of communication. On the other hand, identified soft skills only partially overlap with those reported in other skills classifications. Characteristics specific to New Zealand do not impact the demand for soft skills. Our findings benefit researchers in human aspects of software engineering and to those responsible for staff, curricula and professional development.}

The premise of personalizing mental e-health interventions is that personalization increases user motivation and (thereby) mitigates intervention dropout and enhances clinical effectiveness. In this study, we selected user profile parameters for personalizing a mental e-health intervention for older adults who lost their spouse. We conducted a three-round Delphi study involving an international and interdisciplinary expert panel (N = 16) with two objectives. The first aim was to elicit adaptation strategies that can be used to dynamically readjust the intervention to the user's needs. The second aim was to identify a set of meaningful indicators for monitoring the user from within the grief intervention to escalate from self-help to blended care, whenever advisable. This Delphi study used as starting point an evaluated, text-based grief intervention composed of ten modules, including psychoeducation about grief and cognitive-behavioral exercises to support the user in adjusting their lives after bereavement. Every user follows this grief intervention in a linear fashion from beginning to end. The resulting conceptual adaptation model encompasses dynamic adjustments, as well as one-time adjustments performed at the initialization of the service. On the level of the application structure, the adaptations affect when which topic module is presented to the user. The adaptations further provide strategies for adjusting the text-based content of individual intervention modules dependent on user characteristics and for selecting appropriate reactions to user input. Eighteen monitoring parameters were elicited and grouped into four categories: clinical, behavioral/emotional, interactive, and external. Parameters that were perceived as most urgent to attend to for escalation were Suicidality, Self-destructive behavior, Client-initiated escalation, Unresponsiveness and (Complicated) Grief symptoms.}

By applying a new design that modifies the heat environment by creating organically linked neighborhood green spaces, which encourage pedestrian use, will assist in efforts to conserve and improve the town as a sustainable heritage site. In this research, areas with future greening potential are first extracted based on field surveys and the results of overlaid site appraisals that, by using computer simulations, account for pedestrian thermal comfort, visibility of the historical landscape, and movement. Based on the identified and extracted areas with greening potential, three neighborhood greening scenarios are established: case 1 is based on the existing conditions, case 2 is based on following existing conservation plans, and case 3 is based on maximizing green areas by implementing the proposed pedestrian walkway. A microclimate simulation was done for each scenario and the results are compared specifically from the viewpoint of where and how much each scenario contributes to mitigating the urban heat environment, focusing on changes in physiologically equivalent temperature distribution and numerical changes. From the results, we conclude that the streetscape conservation-oriented neighborhood greening approaches proposed herein should improve the urban heat environment in such historical towns in tropical regions.}

Numerous algorithms have been proposed; however, a better assessment performance is still expected by the market. Nowadays, there are more available relevant data from various sources in urban areas, which have a potential impact on the house value. In this paper, we propose to fuse urban data, i.e., metadata and imagery data, with house attributes to unveil the market value of the property in Philadelphia. Specifically, two deep neural networks, i.e., metadata fusion network and image appraiser, are proposed to extract the representations, i.e., expected levels, from metadata and street-view images, respectively. A boosted regression tree (BRT) is adapted to estimate the market values of houses with the fused metadata and expected levels. The experimental results with the data collected from the city of Philadelphia demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The research presented in this paper also provides the real estate industry a new reference to the property value assessment with the data fusion methodology.}

In order to address such research gap, the objective of this present article is to provide a review of academic, peer-reviewed journal studies that examined the potential effect of social media engagement on international university students’ acculturation process, coping strategies, and psychological adjustments during the period from 2010 to 2019. Moreover, building upon conceptualizations from new media and transcultural research literature, a conceptual framework was developed to classify the relevant studies for further analysis. Overall, these theories and studies synthesized in this paper emphasize the vital role of social media in the acculturation, coping behaviors and mental health for ethnic minorities in the host country. Additionally, certain dimensions of attitudes and behaviors through social media could exert the important influence on the psychological adaption. Therefore, conclusions of the research may assist to further inform practitioners who may encounter newcomers’ experiencing intercultural adjustments and psychological issues in the digital media age. Furthermore, this current review may also help educators determine certain barriers that have not been resolved in campus tactics which may influence the acculturation of sojourning populations.}

abstract = {The Business Process (BP) requirements is specified in the form of software requirements specification (SRS). This SRS serves as a base for software development. The software needs to be developed in a syllogized software development life cycle (SDLC) stages. The SRS which denote the requirements of BP is used as input to the analysis stage from which the paradigm dependent components are to be abstracted. Hither to the components are abstracted manually with the exception of hiatuses of semi-automated methods for few of the components. The SRS is construed with reference to the specific paradigm through which the design is to be developed. Unfortunately, no complete automated methodology exists for the abstraction of all paradigm dependent components. The automated methodology eliminates the possible human errors which would have ripple effect to damage the entire software. This paper develops an innovative, unique methodology to resurrect the SRS statements as modular statements. Further develops an automated methodology for abstraction of control and data flow graphs. Further it develops an automated methodology for abstraction of useful components required for the class diagram. The class diagram emphasizes both structural and behavioral aspects. This facility is effectively used to abstract object class attributes, object methods, visibility, signature, return type etc. Information systems are developed through software projects which use the specific software requirements specification (SRS) provided for them as the base. The SRS contains details of the information system through which appropriate software can be developed. The information systems are also viewed perceptively with different pragmatics like work, work process or usecase. The usecase is one of the prime perspective views whose sum forms the information system. In this paper, an attempt is made to abstract object class, object class attributes, object methods, interrelationships between object classes and starting with/ending with actor from unformatted, unstructured SRS text. This is achieved through our own developed classing and slicing techniques to identify respectively the class structure & object methods. Then usecase is developed through the interrelationships between object methods of different classes and start with or end with the actor. The stages involve moulding the SRS, designing control flow graph for the SRS & data flow table for the SRS statements, developing appropriate classing and slicing criteria, creating actor & actors’ interface attributes table, create slicing criteria for each usecase and then slice relevant statements for each usecase. Here, we have attempted to use Weiser modified algorithm1 to abstract exact usecase. The slicing criterion is obtained through the intersection of actor's interface attributes and the referenced/defined attributes present between two consecutive actors. Attempts have been made to resolve synonyms & heteronyms present in the SRS. The correctness & completeness of the proposed methodology depends on the realization of actor & actors’ interface attributes.}

The main goal of this paper is to propose a model-free approach for estimating macro-level information transfer across heterogeneous populations without any assumptions on such dynamic and complex social networks. With this approach, we estimate macro-level diffusion across mainstream news (News), social networking sites (SNS), and blogs (Blog), and the estimations are compared with outcomes from our previous model-driven approach. We also analyze crowd phenomena in diffusion for News, SNS, and Blog as online social systems in terms of activity, reactivity, and heterogeneity. We find that News is the most active, SNS is the most reactive, and Blog is the most persistent, which governs time-evolving heterogeneity. Discovered crowd phenomena are interpreted with respect to our proposed approaches. The strength and directionality of influence reflect reactivity, while topic-related diffusion patterns reflect heterogeneity. We expect that this study can provide a consistent way of understanding cross-population diffusion in diverse application domains.}

abstract = {Through a survey of 296 female students in Singapore aged 12–18 years regarding their selfie-posting behaviors on Instagram, this study explored teenage girls’ perspectives on the importance of receiving peer feedback on selfies. The associations between peer feedback importance and self-esteem as well as depressed mood were also examined. Drawing on coping theory, this study further investigated how the importance of peer feedback and depressed mood influence girls’ coping responses to the stress from lacking feedback. The results of structural equation modeling demonstrate that self-esteem exerts a negative effect on the importance of peer feedback and depressed mood, but the importance of peer feedback is positively associated with depressed mood. In addition, both the importance of peer feedback and depressed mood positively impact problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies. The results suggest that peer feedback has become a “KPI” of selfie-posting behaviors for teenage girls, and these girls handle the involved stress by a concomitant adoption of both types of coping.}

abstract = {Facial expression recognition has been an active research area in the past 10 years, with growing application areas including avatar animation, neuromarketing and sociable robots. The recognition of facial expressions is not an easy problem for machine learning methods, since people can vary significantly in the way they show their expressions. Even images of the same person in the same facial expression can vary in brightness, background and pose, and these variations are emphasized if considering different subjects (because of variations in shape, ethnicity among others). Although facial expression recognition is very studied in the literature, few works perform fair evaluation avoiding mixing subjects while training and testing the proposed algorithms. Hence, facial expression recognition is still a challenging problem in computer vision. In this work, we propose a simple solution for facial expression recognition that uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network and specific image pre-processing steps. Convolutional Neural Networks achieve better accuracy with big data. However, there are no publicly available datasets with sufficient data for facial expression recognition with deep architectures. Therefore, to tackle the problem, we apply some pre-processing techniques to extract only expression specific features from a face image and explore the presentation order of the samples during training. The experiments employed to evaluate our technique were carried out using three largely used public databases (CK+, JAFFE and BU-3DFE). A study of the impact of each image pre-processing operation in the accuracy rate is presented. The proposed method: achieves competitive results when compared with other facial expression recognition methods – 96.76% of accuracy in the CK+ database – it is fast to train, and it allows for real time facial expression recognition with standard computers.}

We found that social distance, online contact and offline contact were mutually supportive, whereas the background variables included in the regression analysis (age, gender, religiosity, place of residence, education and income) had no effect on either of them.

Maritime deterioration, climate change, cyberattacks, serious and organized crime, epidemics, and state-made threats are just some of the new and growing concerns affecting maritime security. The sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea has given maritime security doctrines and frameworks a new dimension. In this article, the current maritime security approaches and maritime domain or situational awareness (MDA/MSA) model examples of some countries and international organizations from different geographic regions and also the ones that are located in the maritime choke point regions where global maritime trade routes are located and also the effects of the Nord Stream Pipelines sabotages on these are examined in light of the new threats and risks. The principle result reached in this study is that countries and international structures should have a cross governmental maritime security strategy, or at least a doctrine, in order to guide their own maritime situational awareness models and identify information sharing architectures. The most important result of the sabotages on Nord Stream Pipelines for MSA models in this study is that the fastest and most cost-effective method for protecting critical infrastructure under the seas is the concept of systems such as Mothership controlled autonomous and unmanned underwater vehicles, extra large unmanned undersea vehicles and Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellites.}

How the public perceives the COVID-19 vaccine is directly associated with vaccine compliance and vaccination coverage. This study takes a cultural sensitivity perspective and adopts two well-known social media platforms in the United States (Twitter) and China (Weibo) to conduct a public perception comparison around the COVID-19 vaccine. By implementing semantic network analysis, results demonstrate that the two countries' social media users overlapped in themes concerning domestic vaccination policies, priority groups, challenges from COVID-19 variants, and the global pandemic situation. However, Twitter users were prone to disclose individual vaccination experiences, express anti-vaccine attitudes. In comparison, Weibo users manifested evident deference to authorities and exhibited more positive feelings toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Those disparities were explained by the cultural characteristics' differences between the two countries. The findings provide insights into comprehending public health issues in cross-cultural contexts and illustrate the potential of utilizing social media to conduct health informatics studies and investigate public perceptions during public health crisis time.}

With the rise of soft computing techniques interacting with humans, it is important to know not just their accuracy, but also the confusion errors being made—do humans make less random/damaging errors than soft computing? We analyzed the impact of sunglasses and different face masks on the ability to categorize emotional facial expressions in humans and computer systems. Computer systems, represented by VGG19, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 deep learning algorithms, and humans assessed images of people with varying emotional facial expressions and with four different types of coverings, i.e. unmasked, with a mask covering the lower face, a partial mask with transparent mouth window, and with sunglasses. The first contribution of this work is that computer systems were found to be better classifiers (98.48%) than humans (82.72%) for faces without covering (>15% difference). This difference is due to the significantly lower accuracy in categorizing anger, disgust, and fear expressions by humans (p′s<.001). However, the most novel aspect of the work is identifying how soft computing systems make different mistakes to humans on the same data. Humans mainly confuse unclear expressions as neutral emotion, which minimizes affective effects. Conversely, soft techniques often confuse unclear expressions as other emotion categories, which could lead to opposing decisions being made, e.g. a robot categorizing a fearful user as happy. Importantly, the variation in the misclassification can be adjusted by variations in the balance of categories in the training set.}

This type of eyetracking application poses several methodological issues which are discussed in the paper. The eyetracking data are triangulated with data from a speech production task and a self-assessment of language skills. The initial results, show that Ladin is preferred over German and Italian in terms of overall fixation duration, that the order of processing follows the marked position top to bottom and left to right, and that participant's language used to describe the processed signs matches that of the language with the most attention per stimulus. Concerning specific language processing strategies initial interpretations are given which must be followed up on.}

In general, the results show that the speech signals transit from a high dimensional chaotic state in control subjects to a low dimensional chaotic motion in Alzheimer's patients. This can be due to the decreased interaction of variables in psychological state.

Moreover, comprehending the business events of one company can offer strategic advantages to others, facilitating informed decision-making and fostering collaboration within the business ecosystem. Extracting information about these events involves diverse structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data sources, posing challenges for traditional extraction methods. Despite the promise shown by existing openly available LLMs driven by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), they face challenges when dealing with domain-specific queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by seamlessly integrating multiple external data sources of varying structures.

To accomplish this, we have selected six common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s disease (HD), Prion disease and Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) for identification of common regulatory target proteins. A total of sixteen common proteins were identified as target proteins by disease pathway analysis and previous studies based on their association with more than two NDs, including AD. An interaction network of each of the sixteen target proteins was then constructed against causative proteins selected from all six NDs by using the STRING 9.1 program. Pathway analysis and the protein–protein interaction network suggested that CASP-3 and CASP-8 were associated with the maximum number of selected NDs and may therefore be the most potent target proteins for treatment of multi-neurodegenerative diseases.}

Different authors have theorized that deindividuation nullifies the effects of normative influence, but the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects theorizes that users will conform even when deindividuated, but only if social identity is made salient. The two typologies of social influence have never been studied in comparison, therefore in our work, we decided to create an online experiment to observe how the same variables affect them, and in particular how deindividuation works in both cases. The 181 experimental subjects that took part, performed 3 tasks: one aiming to elicit normative influence, and two semantic tasks created to test informational influence. Entropy has been used as a mathematical assessment of information availability. Our results show that normative influence becomes almost ineffective within CMC (1.4% of conformity) when subjects are deindividuated. Informational influence is generally more effective than normative influence within CMC (15–29% of conformity), but similarly to normative influence, it is inhibited by deindividuation.}

abstract = {The health monitoring of induction motor is considered as a developing technology for online detection of faults that actually even take place at initial stage. In the current paper, an embedded system has been designed and simulated to simulate two major faults namely broken rotor bar fault and abnormal gear teeth fault. An extensive review of induction machine faults, diagnostic techniques of induction motor has been investigated in detail. Also, this paper deals with a novel effective technique for detecting the broken rotor fault and abnormal gear teeth fault of the induction motor. A precise finding of the fault characteristic parameter of motor is a new investigation hotspot in the Broken Rotor Bar fault diagnosis of induction motors. Broken Rotor Bar is one of the generally occurred faults in induction motor, which also might initiate critical motor damage to the motor if not found out in a right time. Also, gears that are popularly considered as most important components in the mechanical power conduction have received lots of concern in the area of condition monitoring over years and the current study is not obviously free from this. The experimental results and software simulation concluded that MPSO offers better optimization for both broken rotor bar and abnormal gear teeth fault.}

This issue is especially problematic for inexperienced users. To address these requirements, we have extended our previous work Memo Graph, an ontology visualization tool, to provide a user-centered interactive solution for extracting and visualizing Linked Data. It takes aim to provide comprehensible and legible visualization. To manage scalability, it is built on an incremental approach to extract descriptive summarization from a given Linked Data endpoint where it becomes possible to generate a “summary graph” from the most important data (middle-out navigation approach). It offers user interfaces that reduce task complexity for users, especially the inexperienced ones. We tested Memo Graph on a number of Linked Data datasets with encouraging results. We discuss the promising results derived from an empirical evaluation, which affirmed that Memo Graph is useful in visualizing Linked Data and usable.}

We are going to use audiovisual case methodology through the use of short film clips, usually real stories, to help students understand the practical implications of theoretical concepts explained in the classroom. A theoretical model test uses data from 32 business students from the Open University of Catalonia. The first results show positive attitudes toward a new technological resource ‘audio-visual cases’. They indicate that the use of this tool can improve the comprehension of a problem and its origins and, at the same time, stimulate learning. In addition, this tool helps to develop critical thinking competency. This study offers important contributions to an e-learning environment and their applicability to the workplace, since it is the first type of research about the impact of audiovisual cases in the acquisition of critical thinking competency.

However, precisely how trust and trust-based management strategy influence team performance have remained elusive. This paper develops a method of trust-based team management to understand which managerial strategy has what impact on performance, and to discern decision alternatives. The method concentrates on providing a dynamic model of trust considering trust relationship initialization, updating trust based on experience and determining what trust should have an effect on. The model is used to explain how the trust-based management strategy caused the team to evolve in particular directions rather than others. Some prescriptions are put forward for the proper management of team. We argue that a human-machine collaborative team is a multi-agent system and team members are autonomous agents. Three computational experiments are conducted under different internal and external conditions for the artificial team, yielding the following results. (1) Under different difficulty of tasks, trust may produce either positive or negative effect on performance. (2) Trust-based management strategy dose has effect on performance under difficult task. (3) The results demonstrate the different effect of three trust-based management strategies on performance. The study method and findings presented herein are appropriate for other studies focusing on dynamic effects on team, laying the foundations for new ideas for studying team building and team development.}

The primary purpose of the current empirical research is to unearth whether and how WeChat interaction could enhance overseas students’ sense of subjective well-being by concentrating on social integration, bridging relationships, and bonding relationships. Using web-based data of 228 Chinese subjects, the obtained results reveal that the time spent on WeChat significantly and directly impacts users’ subjective well-being. Additionally, the findings demonstrate that social integration, bridging relationships, bonding relationships are all significant predictors to subjective well-being. Furthermore, the perceptions of social integration and social capital could play the crucial mediating roles in the connection between WeChat use and the dependent variable of subjective well-being. Therefore, these outcomes may shed light on a more nuanced comprehending of the influence of the new social media interaction on sojourner’s social adaption and overall life quality in the digital age.}

To better understand this multidimensional geography, our paper develops a new geodemographic classification for the spatial extent of Great Britain. In this model, we integrate a range of new small area measures that are drawn from multiple new forms of data including consumer purchasing data, survey and open data sources. Our analytical approach innovatively provides an integration of machine learning into a small-area estimation technique to obtain Lower Super Output Area / Data Zone estimates of Internet use, alongside a range of online engagement and consumption measures. Following the collation of a range of input measures, we implemented a more standard geodemographic framework that utilises the unsupervised clustering algorithm k-means to produce a map of the multidimensional characteristics of digital inequality for Great Britain; creating the Internet User Classification (IUC). Our outputs provide a new and nuanced understanding of the contemporary salient characteristics of digital inequality in Great Britain, which we evaluate both internally and externally within the context of preparations for the 2021 UK Census of the Population, exploring the geodemographic patterns of Census test response rates and the prevalence to complete the survey online. Our innovative work illustrates the strength of a geodemographic approach in mapping spatial patterns of digital inequality, and through the presented application concerning Census response rates and characteristics we demonstrate how the IUC can be operationalised within such settings for local intervention or benchmarking.}

In this study, partition around medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm is used to partition 105 Leeds community areas into four distinct groups based on their crime rates. Silhouette index and adjusted rand index (ARI) were used to evaluate the validity of clusters internally and externally. The new typology developed, has revealed new insights demonstrating the relationship between social cohesion and crime rates in Leeds community areas.

This method is proposed by Semiotic Engineering and involves the participation of users for groupware systems, called MAC-G. By applying it as an evaluation for learning management systems in three dimensions, it proved to be appropriate although missing some categories to be more effective. The evaluation using MAC-G fleshed out some clues for changing the way teacher plans the interaction and also pointed out the need for an extension more appropriate to 3D Virtual Environments.}

We conclude that stickies enable an effective silent ideation by hushing domineering senior participants and amplifying opinions from junior and mid-career participants. Finally, implications are drawn for stickies' mediating ability in culturally specific collaborative practices.}

First, we will study what kind of skills or reactions that the player will earn after playing kind of games. These reactions can be explicit or implicit and positive or negative reactions such as development, improving social relationships, enhance the problem solving skills or violence, aggression, anxiety or stressful reaction.

However, very few methods are proposed to detect joints in the human body. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid framework to detect joints automatically by using depth camera. In the proposed method, joints are categorized into two classes: implicit joints and dominant joints. Implicit joints are the joints on the torso, such as neck and shoulders. Dominant joints include elbows and knees. In the hybrid framework we proposed, a loose skeleton model is used to locate implicit joints, and data-driven method is applied to detect dominant joints. The highlight of the proposed work is that geodesic features of the human body are used to build the skeleton model and detect joints. To evaluate our work, experiments are conducted on the dataset recorded by a Microsoft Kinect and compared with state-of-art methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed work can deliver stable and accurate detection results of joints.}

Here 102 Muslim and 103 Christian high-school students spent eight Internet sessions in either a Dual Identity Electronic(E)-Contact (DIEC) program integrating interfaith information and intergroup contact, or a Control program involving within-faith information and ingroup contact. Participants also completed pre- and post-program measures of intergroup bias. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a computerised text analysis program, we objectively analysed data from across the eight Internet sessions, and found that groups in the two conditions expressed emotions differently. That is, the DIEC chat groups used more affect and positive emotion words, and less anger and sadness words than the Control chat groups. Mediation analyses showed that anger and sadness mediated the intervention effect on T2, T3 and T4 intergroup bias. In other words, DIEC chat groups’ reduced expressions of anger and sadness were related to reduced short- and long-term intergroup bias. These findings highlight the significant role that structured Internet interactions can play in creating positive and long-lasting intergroup relations.}

Further, we sought to use participants’ responses to cybersecurity scenarios to create profiles that describe their values and individual factors including personality. Participants (n = 193) in our study responded to five different ethically sensitive cybersecurity scenarios in random order, selecting their action in that scenario and rating and ranking of the ethical principles (i.e., Beneficence, Non-Maleficence, Justice, Autonomy, Explicability) behind that action. Using participants’ demographics, personality, values, and cyber hygiene practices, we created profiles using machine learning to predict participants’ choices and the principle of most importance to them across scenarios. Further, we found that, generalising, for our participants Autonomy was the most important ethical principle in our scenarios, followed by Justice. Our study also suggests that participants felt they had some agency in their decision making and they were able to weigh up different ethical principles.}

The main case study was conducted in an academic hackathon-like course, where students addressed loneliness-related challenges during four full days using a configured web platform. In a follow-up case study, the adaptability of this approach to small-scale settings of a 90-minute DT workshop was explored. The students filled in questionnaires, which examined their empathy development in three dimensions: Skill, Orientation, and Being. The findings show the benefits of the web platform and the extent to which these academic educational programs fostered empathy and innovation and highlights the challenges, opportunities, and benefits of fostering new educational programs that allow hybrid participation, involving external stakeholders, and guide the students to handle real challenges.

The study evaluated both short-term (one week) and long-term (six weeks) effects of the intervention on majority members’ outgroup attitudes. The study findings revealed that, compared to majority controls (n = 41), participants in the intervention condition reported a greater decrease in intergroup bias and anxiety in the short- and long-terms. A mediation effect of intergroup anxiety was also found; the intervention reduced majority members’ intergroup anxiety in the short-term which was related to reduced long-term intergroup bias. These encouraging findings highlight that carefully designed cooperative electronic-contact programs tailored to promote majority individuals’ endorsement of the Integrationist orientation, can offer an efficacious route to acculturation researchers interested in promoting this strategy, improving in turn majority members’ outgroup attitudes toward minorities.}

abstract = {Deep learning has shown superiority to extract more representative features from multimedia data in recent years. Recently, the most typical graph convolutional networks (GCN) has achieved excellent performance in the semi-supervised framework-based data representation learning tasks. GCN successfully generalizes traditional convolutional neural networks to encode arbitrary graphs by exploiting the graph Laplacian-based sample structure information. However, GCN only fuses the static structure information. It is difficult to guarantee that its structure information is optimal during the training process and applicable for all practical applications. To tackle the above problem, in this paper, we propose a manifold regularized dynamic graph convolutional network (MRDGCN). The proposed MRDGCN automatically updates the structure information by manifold regularization until model fitting. In particular, we build an optimization convolution layer formulation to acquire the optimal structure information. Thus, MRDGCN can automatically learn high-level sample features to improve the performance of data representation learning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we apply MRDGCN on the semi-supervised classification tasks. The extensive experiment results on human activity datasets and citation network datasets validate the performance of MRDGCN compared with GCN and other semi-supervised learning methods.}

However, to date, there is no consensus on the extent to which adolescents and emerging adults perpetrate and experience CDA. Based on the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines, the present work performed separate meta-analyses for studies involving adolescents and emerging adults. This study aims to estimate the pooled prevalence of CDA perpetration and victimization and try to explain discrepancies in the literature. In all, 69 publications (25 adolescent and 44 emerging adult studies) on CDA were identified through a systematic literature search, including 74 independent samples with a total of 62,376 participants. The results showed that the overall prevalence of CDA perpetration was 24.0% and victimization was 36.9% among adolescents, while 44.6% and 43.4% for CDA perpetration and victimization among emerging adults. Moderator analyses revealed that higher rates of CDA perpetration and victimization were found for older adolescents. In addition, control dimension had higher rates of CDA perpetration and victimization compared to direct aggression dimension among emerging adults. Finally, the assessed lifetime prevalence of CDA perpetration was higher than that assessed in the last year in emerging adults, whereas unpublished studies showed a higher prevalence of CDA victimization compared to published studies in adolescents. In sum, current evidence contributes to a better understanding of the prevalence and influencing factors for CDA among adolescents and emerging adults. Prevention and intervention programs are urgently required to reduce CDA behaviors in adolescents and emerging adults.}

abstract = {Background
Early identification of pregnant women at high risk of developing gestational diabetes (GDM) is desirable as effective lifestyle interventions are available to prevent GDM and to reduce associated adverse outcomes. Personalised probability of developing GDM during pregnancy can be determined using a risk prediction model. These models extend from traditional statistics to machine learning methods; however, accuracy remains sub-optimal.
Objective
We aimed to compare multiple machine learning algorithms to develop GDM risk prediction models, then to determine the optimal model for predicting GDM.
Methods
A supervised machine learning predictive analysis was performed on data from routine antenatal care at a large health service network from January 2016 to June 2021. Predictor set 1 were sourced from the existing, internationally validated Monash GDM model: GDM history, body mass index, ethnicity, age, family history of diabetes, and past poor obstetric history. New models with different predictors were developed, considering statistical principles with inclusion of more robust continuous and derivative variables. A randomly selected 80% dataset was used for model development, with 20% for validation. Performance measures, including calibration and discrimination metrics, were assessed. Decision curve analysis was performed.
Results
Upon internal validation, the machine learning and logistic regression model’s area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 71% to 93% across the different algorithms, with the best being the CatBoost Classifier (CBC). Based on the default cut-off point of 0.32, the performance of CBC on predictor set 4 was: Accuracy (85%), Precision (90%), Recall (78%), F1-score (84%), Sensitivity (81%), Specificity (90%), positive predictive value (92%), negative predictive value (78%), and Brier Score (0.39).
Conclusions
In this study, machine learning approaches achieved the best predictive performance over traditional statistical methods, increasing from 75 to 93%. The CatBoost classifier method achieved the best with the model including continuous variables.}

abstract = {Objective
To demonstrate how non-negative matrix factorization can be used to learn a temporal topic model over a large collection of primary care clinical notes, characterizing diverse COVID-19 pandemic effects on the physical/mental/social health of residents of Toronto, Canada.
Materials and Methods
The study employs a retrospective open cohort design, consisting of 382,666 primary care progress notes from 44,828 patients, 54 physicians, and 12 clinics collected 01/01/2017 through 31/12/2020. Non-negative matrix factorization uncovers a meaningful latent topical structure permeating the corpus of primary care notes. The learned latent topical basis is transformed into a multivariate time series data structure. Time series methods and plots showcase the evolution/dynamics of learned topics over the study period and allow the identification of COVID-19 pandemic effects. We perform several post-hoc checks of model robustness to increase trust that descriptive/unsupervised inferences are stable over hyper-parameter configurations and/or data perturbations.
Results
Temporal topic modelling uncovers a myriad of pandemic-related effects from the expressive clinical text data. In terms of direct effects on patient-health, topics encoding respiratory disease symptoms display altered dynamics during the pandemic year. Further, the pandemic was associated with a multitude of indirect patient-level effects on topical domains representing mental health, sleep, social and familial dynamics, measurement of vitals/labs, uptake of prevention/screening maneuvers, and referrals to medical specialists. Finally, topic models capture changes in primary care practice patterns resulting from the pandemic, including changes in EMR documentation strategies and the uptake of telemedicine.
Conclusion
Temporal topic modelling applied to a large corpus of rich primary care clinical text data, can identify a meaningful topical/thematic summarization which can provide policymakers and public health stakeholders a passive, cost-effective, technology for understanding holistic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the primary healthcare system and community/public-health.}

The difference is due to the different perceptions of each person. From these problems then the need of machine sorting system on agriculture is felt important. Therefore, researchers will conduct research on mango sortation system. Mango has many types such as “Harum Manis”, “Apple”, “Gincu”, etc. In this study type of mango that will be studied is mango “Gincu” because has a good color distribution. The goal of the research is to create a system that can sort mango that ripe or unripe. The method that used to do this research is separated into few step: problem identification, algorithm development, implementation and evaluation. The system is made using C language, Computer Vision and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) so the system can detect the color of mango that has been ripe or unripe. The output of this research will be compared to related research. The final output of this research is the system can detect the ripe or unripe mango with 94% accuracy.}

This paper provides an overview of the development of pre-service teachers' perceived 21st-century skills and dispositions. The quantitative data was collected in three phases during 2014, 2015, and 2016 at three Finnish universities. The number of respondents at each measurement point varied from 209 to 267. Data were analysed using latent growth curve modeling. The study focuses on students' perceptions of three areas related to 21st-century skills: learning skills, collaboration dispositions, and skills to use ICT. The results show that the three areas evolved in different ways. Learning skills and collaboration dispositions show up as yearly assessments that remain at the same level, with small differences among respondents, unlike skills to use ICT with bigger yearly changes. The measured areas also appear as separate entities throughout the bachelor's studies, with small or non-significant correlations. These results reveal important new perspectives on how pre-service teachers perceive 21st-century skills and how perceptions evolve during teacher education.}

The collection and analysis of this information in Smart Home environments poses several challenges, mainly data variability, and the management and synchronization of devices, which have limited the adoption of this kind of solutions. Researchers tend to work focused on providing solutions to specific issues and, in research environments that share infrastructure, such as living labs, it is common that previous developments of other teams are not reused. This process is suboptimal and does not allow understanding the Smart Home as a single space, but as a set of functional islands. To overcome these obstacles, a novel collaborative semantic framework is proposed for the extraction, characterization, and formalization of data to enable its reutilization and interpretation. The framework is based on the concept of activity, decomposed as a series of actions and events, and follows current trends in the domain of Activities of Daily Living and Smart Homes. A set of interoperability enablers based on JSON schemas and formalized descriptions of the domain have been proposed as the main facilitators of collaboration and the integration of elements coexisting in the Smart Home environment. The evaluation of the framework through the development of two research projects showed significant benefits, improving the overall quality of the solutions and enriching the extraction of insights through the correlated analysis of data.}

To our knowledge, no attempt has been made at achieving domain models that consider multiple languages. Our approach combines Multilingual Educational Ontologies with Learning Objects in different languages. Wikipedia is a valuable resource to accomplish this purpose. In this scenario, we have developed LiDom Builder, a framework that uses Wikipedia as an additional knowledge base for the automatic generation of Multilingual Domain Modules from textbooks. The framework includes domain-independent term extraction methods to identify which topics of Wikipedia are related to the domain to be learnt and, also, extracts their equivalents in other languages. In order to complete the Educational Ontology, we have defined a method to extract pedagogical relationships from Wikipedia and other general-purpose knowledge bases. From this task, we highlight the extraction of relationship that will allow the sequencing of the topics in Technology Supported Learning Systems. In addition, LiDom Builder takes advantage of the structured contents of Wikipedia to identify text fragments that can be used for educational purposes, classifies them and generates their corresponding Learning Objects. The interlanguage links between topics of Wikipedia are used to create Learning Objects in other languages.}

An analysis of 1805 posts and comments on blogs and Facebook leading up to the May 1, 2013 protest reveals that while organizers and protestors resonated in their development of diagnostic, prognostic and motivational frames, they placed different emphasis on the frames.

Scholars have discussed the related topics in other fields. However, these studies did not specifically target the field of AI and primarily relied on correlation methods, which may not lead to a causal conclusion. Analyzing around 0.6 million AI collaborative papers between 1950 and 2019 with 872,727 authors and 9,258 affiliations, this study tests the causal effect of multiple-affiliation collaboration on the disruption in AI by using descriptive analysis and a causal inference method, i.e., the Propensity Score Matching (PSM). We propose an improved affiliation diversity indicator to measure the distribution of affiliation differences in multiple-affiliation collaboration by taking disparity into account. Our results show that affiliation diversity exerts a negative causal effect on the disruption of papers in AI: (a) The average level of AI papers with diverse affiliation types or affiliation countries of authors is less disruptive than those with a single type or country. (b) Affiliation diversity will causally reduce the disruption of papers in AI by 2.006%∼5.891%. That indicates that AI papers with high affiliation diversity are significantly less disruptive, ranging from 2.006% to 5.891%, compared to those without. We cross-validate the findings by using five comparison experiments and five other matching methods. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of multiple-affiliation collaboration on AI disruption.}

Two of the challenges with the Semantic Web technologies are the lack of multilingual support and the complexity of integrating multiple ontologies used by this technology. The objective of this paper is to present efforts that will help users who use the Arabic language to ask natural language questions and then get their semantic representation in SPARQL that allows them to be executed and get the relevant semantic results. This natural language interface makes more use of the cross-domain ontologies and hence improves the understanding of their inquiries, which is needed in some critical domains such as health and food where precise advice is essential. The approach we followed is multilingual and overcomes the limitations in the published relevant systems. With the proposed approach, users who speak Arabic can use the widely published ontologies in English without concern for the translation of their questions. The proposed approach will take care of matching the entered questions with the relevant ontologies to produce their semantic Web queries. The proposed approach has been implemented and empirically evaluated. The experimental results are promising, which will help in improving the awareness and usage of the Semantic Web by different lingual and cultural users.}

Due to the diverse service architecture, detailed architectures & multiple interrelationships that occur in the cloud, implementation is complicated. A few other previous studies attempt to integrate the different fault tolerance frameworks and solutions suggested for the cloud environment, but some accounts occur to be constrained. This research article provides a detailed survey of the state-of-the-art research on emerging methods of fault tolerance for Cloud Computing & categorizes techniques of fault tolerance into three categories: Reactive Methods, Proactive Methods & Resilient Methods. Reactive Methods allow the system to reach a defect condition but instead attempt to get the device back up. Proactive Methods help to prevent the device from reaching a defective condition by introducing actions to minimize defects before impacting the device. On either side, newly developed Resilient Methods strive to reduce the amount of time a device takes to find from a malfunction. In the Resilient Methods context, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence played an important role in mapping the recovery period to a task to be configured. This survey offers a comprehensive and detailed description of the various faults kinds, factors, & different methods to fault tolerance used in the cloud. In light of their Basic Methods & some other specific characteristics, & also offers a Clear study of different tolerance mechanisms for failures & provides a comparative study of the structures under the article. It is noted that approaches of fault tolerance directed to checkpoint restart and replication are mainly included to address the crash faults in the cloud.}
