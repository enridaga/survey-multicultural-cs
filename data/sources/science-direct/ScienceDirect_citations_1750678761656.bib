abstract = {Cross-cultural design in the globalized marketplace faces the challenges of linguistic, geographical, and cultural complexity, which limits designers’ ability to create good cross-cultural product designs. This study proposes a “cross-cultural supervisor” approach based on the large language model (LLM) and the CO-STAR framework, which aims to enhance designers’ understanding of multiculturalism and optimize design concepts. By constructing a cross-cultural design metric system and quantifying cultural factors via the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), this method provides scientific support for the decision-making of cross-cultural design. We propose two main strategies: 1) optimizing cultural sensitivity and feeding back cultural knowledge in GPT-4 on the basis of the CO-STAR framework and 2) generating and evaluating design solutions via GPT-4. The effectiveness of this strategy was verified, showing that the cross-cultural supervisor approach significantly enhances cross-cultural design reports. This approach is particularly effective in design areas where cultural backgrounds and personal preferences strongly influence product outcomes. By offering insights into aesthetics, materials, and local traditions, it enables designers to adapt products to the unique cultural and behavioral expectations of diverse markets. In the era of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), this study presents a new methodology for cross-cultural product design, contributing valuable theoretical and practical insights.}

Digital technology has caused a rethink of the leadership approach in a digital environment that is continuous, dynamic, proactive, and complex, which is driven by phenomena such as globalisation (connectiveness and integration), mass immigration, and multiculturalism. E-privacy requires consent from all parties; how to engage them in the process is a central theme of the paper. Furthermore the type of leadership required is discussed and how it needs to develop in the future, which is identified as the post-General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) era. Last, but not least, is a discussion of the challenges the e-privacy debate presents, such as collective or group e-privacy, and moving from a tick-box approach to GDPR to a recognised global framework that requires commitment from the CEO and the senior management team. Leverage via reputational damage and the power of a regulatory regime could be tools to make businesses commit in spirit to the GDPR framework and view it not just as a penalty for doing business.}

Similarly, software companies have become more active in diversity and inclusion (D&I) topics, aiming to create more inclusive work environments. However, the way diversity and inclusion are approached inside software engineering university education remains less clear. This study investigates the current state of D&I in software engineering education and faculties in Finland. An online survey (N = 30) was conducted among Finnish software engineering university teachers to investigate which approaches and case examples of D&I are most commonly used by software engineering teachers in Finland. In addition, it was researched how software engineering teachers perceive the importance of D&I in their courses. As a result of the quantitative and thematic analysis, a framework to identify attitudes, approaches, challenges and pedagogical strategies when implementing D&I themes in software engineering education is presented. This framework also offers a process for integrating D&I themes for the curriculum or at the faculty level. The findings of this study emphasize that there is a continuing need for diverse-aware education and training. The results underline the responsibility of universities to ensure that future professionals are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to promote D&I in the field of software engineering.}

This follows the global consensus of the world’s countries on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) through the United Nations as its own strategy for world peace through equitable prosperity, subsequently embraced by the World Health Organization for measuring and advancing toward equitable health for all. This chapter begins with an historical overview of this development strategy following World War II through the Cold War to the present moment with the increasing introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) for social good generally, and AI advancing the SDGs specifically, or “AI × SDGs.” This ecosystem model is essentially a whole-of-world approach that bridges whole-of-government and whole-of-society movements to unite diverse sectors, stakeholders, and belief systems for the advancement of personal and population health at scale, ultimately to advance humanity’s health. This chapter features a detailed breakdown of concrete use cases of AI according to specific SDGs, including those in precision agriculture to reduce poverty and hunger, enhanced climate change prediction and mitigation, affordable clean energy transitions (with advances protecting biodiversity), and more equitable and decolonized global–local public–private partnerships (spanning mRNA vaccines and digital diagnostics, including lab-on-a-chip tests especially for low-income countries and remote areas). This chapter also considers such AI development advances for health in the global context of polycrises, which boost the risk of the Great Divergence becoming permanent—at least for the foreseeable future. This chapter considers how climate change, COVID-19, Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine (driving further global debt, food, and energy crises), worsening demographics (with the growing global burden of disease), and increasing regional conflicts raise the likelihood and duration of the growing separation of the Global South from the Global West and North, with their AI and digital technology–powered advanced economies. This chapter therefore considers how responsible AI may bridge this structural separation through the sustainable development strategy, without which the power and riches of the Global North are not just morally but also pragmatically undermined without more equitable global growth.}

abstract = {Background
Informal caregivers are vital in caring for their family and friends at home who may have illnesses or disabilities. In particular, the demands for caregiving can be even more challenging for those with limited resources, support systems, and language barriers, such as immigrant informal caregivers. They face complex challenges in providing care for their relatives. These challenges can be related to sociocultural diversity, language barriers, and health care system navigation. Acknowledging the global context of the increasing number of immigrants is essential in designing inclusive mobile health apps.
Objective
This study aims to investigate the needs of immigrant informal caregivers in Sweden and discuss the application of the Persuasive System Design Model (PSDM) to develop an e-coaching prototype. By addressing the unique challenges faced by immigrant informal caregivers, this study will contribute to the development of more effective and inclusive mobile health apps.
Methods
The participants were considered immigrants and included in the study if they and their parents were born outside of Sweden. Through various channels, such as the National Association of Relatives, rehabilitation departments at municipalities, and immigrant groups, we recruited 13 immigrant informal caregivers. These immigrant informal caregivers were primarily women aged 18 to 40 years. Most participants belonged to the Middle Eastern region whereas some were from North Africa. However, all of them spoke Arabic. We used semistructured interviews to gather data from the participants in Arabic, which were translated into English. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis and discussed in relation to the extended PSDM. The needs of the caregivers were compared with the description of persuasive design principles, and a design principle was chosen based on the match. The PSDM was extended if the need description did not match any principles. Several brainstorming and prototyping sessions were conducted to design the mobile e-coaching app.
Results
Immigrant informal caregivers have various needs in their caregiving role. They reported a need for training on the illness and future caregiving needs, assistance with understanding the Swedish language and culture, and help with accessing internet-based information and services. They also required recognition and appreciation for their efforts, additional informal support, and easy access to health care services, which can be important for their mental health. The PSDM was adapted to the informal caregiving context by adding “facilitating conditions” and “verbal encouragement” as additional persuasive design principles. This study also presents the subsequent mobile e-coaching app for immigrant informal caregivers in Sweden.
Conclusions
This study revealed important immigrant informal caregivers’ needs based on which design suggestions for a mobile e-coaching app were presented. We also proposed an adapted PSDM, for the informal caregiving context. The adapted PSDM can be further used to design digital interventions for caregiving.}

Industry 5.0 poses new challenges in the area of people management, including those related to workforce skills required by employers and necessary in the near future in the efficient management of companies, their effective operation, and a competitive advantage in the market. The concept of Industry 5.0 requires companies and managers to change their attitude to employees. Their new modus operandi should cover new requirements regarding workforce skills and new ways of attracting and retaining human capital equipped with adequate skills. The aim of this article is to present workforce skills identified by managers from three European countries (Portugal, France, and Greece) as particularly important in Industry 5.0. The research methods used in the study are a literature review and 12 individual in-depth interviews conducted in 2023 (four interviewees from each country covered by the study). The analysis of literature and the interviews conducted by the author reveal that workforce skills in Era 5.0 are moving in the direction of soft skills and can be divided into four groups: problem-solving, working with people, technology use and development, and self-management. Workforce skills in Industry 5.0, especially those related to managing multicultural teams, is a research area which has not been extensively studied so far. Even though the study described in the article is only qualitative and conducted on a small sample, its results justify recommending further in-depth studies and can be used by companies to improve their search for employees who possess skills which correspond to the requirements of Industry 5.0.}

abstract = {Background
Linguistic accessibility has an important impact on the reception and utilization of translated health resources among multicultural and multilingual populations. Linguistic understandability of health translation has been understudied.
Objective
Our study aimed to develop novel machine learning models for the study of the linguistic accessibility of health translations comparing Chinese translations of the World Health Organization health materials with original Chinese health resources developed by the Chinese health authorities.
Methods
Using natural language processing tools for the assessment of the readability of Chinese materials, we explored and compared the readability of Chinese health translations from the World Health Organization with original Chinese materials from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Results
A pairwise adjusted t test showed that the following 3 new machine learning models achieved statistically significant improvement over the baseline logistic regression in terms of area under the curve: C5.0 decision tree (95% CI –0.249 to –0.152; P<0.001), random forest (95% CI 0.139-0.239; P<0.001) and extreme gradient boosting tree (95% CI 0.099-0.193; P<0.001). There was, however, no significant difference between C5.0 decision tree and random forest (P=0.513). The extreme gradient boosting tree was the best model, achieving statistically significant improvement over the C5.0 model (P=0.003) and the random forest model (P=0.006) at an adjusted Bonferroni P value at 0.008.
Conclusions
The development of machine learning algorithms significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of current approaches to the evaluation of the linguistic accessibility of Chinese health information, especially Chinese health translations in relation to original health resources. Although the new algorithms developed were based on Chinese health resources, they can be adapted for other languages to advance current research in accessible health translation, communication, and promotion.}

The purpose of this paper was to examine the possibility of using Augmented Reality to reduce memory-related ethnic bias towards places and to increase understanding of multicultural place meaning and change emotional attitudes towards historical sites.
Background
Theoretical and empirical works suggest that the direct, embodied contact with place's history facilitates understanding of its past. Places which were deprived of historical continuity are less liked and threatened by ethnic bias in collective memory. AR technology gives a possibility of recreating past of such places and in a consequence tests an influence of experience of place's history on psychological aspects of the people-place relationship.
Method
A between-subjects experiment was conducted, in which participants either walked with an AR application displaying historical photos in real environment or watched photos on computers. The chosen place was the former Jewish district in Warsaw, Poland.
Results
The results of multiple regression analyses showed that the AR application can facilitate positive attitudes towards a place, reduce ethnic bias and enhance multicultural place meaning.
Conclusions
We argue that AR could be used as a method of reviving (multi)cultural heritage, but also as a tool of reducing prejudices and increasing openness to other cultures and traditions.}

Data from the field of GPT practice includes the recurrent observation that some GPT practitioners seem to thrive in the cross-cultural context of the GPT, while others flounder. This research paper explores how cultural diversity influences motivation and performance within the GPT. It extracts themes of interest from a detailed literature review and further explores them in the context of a field study of 79 GPT practitioners in 21 countries. CQ-motivation emerges as a potent predictor of motivation and performance in the GPT. The study concludes that GPT team selection processes which actively leverage CQ-motivation, project manager ownership, and the prioritisation of attitude over functional skills, will be supportive of superior GPT performance.}

abstract = {Introduction
In the WHO European Region, 44 of 53 reporting Member States (MS) have a national digital health strategy (NDHS) or policy. Their formulation is heterogenous and evolving and should best reflect public common interest. This research aims to explore how a public value approach improves the relevance of digital health policies and services, increasing their capacity to better serve the diverse range of societal interests. It utilises the guiding values within the French NDHS as an example before discussing other digital health policies such as the European Heath Data Space.
Methods
Three homogenous focus group discussions were conducted in November and December 2023. Each focus group separately gathered distinct stakeholders: public clients, health professionals, private sector. 19 participants were included in the study. Data collection comprised live polling and semi-structured discussion. Results were analysed considering the pre-defined stakeholder groups and the values discussed during the study.
Results
Findings reveal both technical and cultural challenges in digital health that highlight the need for adaptable frameworks across different contexts. Stakeholder insights informed a framework classifying public values into democratic and managerial categories, suggesting themes that may be relevant to digital health strategies in other national and regional settings.
Discussion
Public value is discussed as a multidimensional concept, and the plurality of its perceptions give basis for tailored approaches to serve different value-beneficiaries comprehensively. We propose this values-based approach as a systematic model for supra-, sub-, and national scales and additional policy topics, beyond digital health strategies.
Conclusion
The study suggests that using a public value lens considering multiple perceptions is valuable for advancing digital health policy in a responsible and ethical manner. Such an approach could promote wider governance of and adoption of digital health. To evolve the framework, application in multiple and large ecosystems at different levels should be considered.}

In this context, computer sciences combined with engineering processes constitutes a powerful way for companies to be able to improve process management, to interact with such markets in an efficient and effective way. The main objective of this article is to use Arena simulation software, to quantitatively predict the impact of improvements applied in metal surface treatment processes, based on tools to support Lean thinking. A case study in a Portuguese company in the metalworking sector is presented, in which it is verified that the proposed improvements in terms of the factory layout and resource management, suggested by the comparison between simulations of the current state of the company and the improved one, streamline the processes of finishing in metals, namely zinc coating and lacquering which prevent the occurrence of oxidation and the consequent corrosion of the base metals, by adding other metals and materials to their surface, which adhere and protect it. Through the results obtained, it is concluded that the reduction of waiting times and transport of stocks without production and of work-in-progress, as well as the increase of the productive capacity, make the company more able to guarantee the satisfaction of the requirements of its customers and improve its positioning in the market compared to its competitors.}

This study employed social media data from Twitter to quantitatively analyse the soundscape of Hong Kong Victoria Harbour waterfronts, offering a novel perspective in urban sensory research. Through comparative analysis between tourists and residents, it uncovered how different groups perceive soundscapes in these specific urban waterfronts setting. Utilizing a two-step analytical approach—initially applying rank-size distribution and mean difference index—this study mapped the spatial distribution of soundscapes and used global and local regression models to explore their correlations with key urban features such as building density, population density, and ethnic diversity. The findings revealed distinct spatial patterns in how soundscapes are experienced by tourists and residents at the Victoria Harbour waterfronts, influenced significantly by the built environment. For instance, while residents experience negative auditory sensory in high building density areas, tourists perceive these areas positively. Furthermore, this research underscored the differing correlations of population density on soundscape experience among these groups. Residents enjoy positive soundscape connections in bustling areas, whereas tourists prefer quieter environments. Moreover, the research also found the differences in how residents and tourists accept multicultural soundscapes. This study not only contributed theoretically by linking soundscapes to urban and socio-economic variables but also demonstrated the potential of social media data as a tool for studying urban sensory. The study findings could offer insights that are relevant to planning and design of urban waterfronts.}

Computed tomography scans of 678 mandibles from children and young adults between 0 and 22 years old were included in the model. The mandibles were segmented using a semi-automatic or automatic (artificial intelligence-based) segmentation method. Point correspondence among the samples was achieved by rigid registration, followed by non-rigid registration of a symmetrical template onto each sample. The registration process was validated with adequate results. Principal component analysis was used to gain insight in the variation within the dataset and to investigate age-related changes and sexual dimorphism. The presented growth model is accessible globally and free-of-charge for scientists, physicians and forensic investigators for any kind of purpose deemed suitable. The versatility of the model opens up new possibilities in the fields of oral and maxillofacial surgery, forensic sciences or biological anthropology. In clinical settings, the model may aid diagnostic decision-making, treatment planning and treatment evaluation.}

Gender bias in machine translation (MT) has been studied for over a decade, a time marked by societal, linguistic, and technological shifts. With the early optimism for a quick solution in mind, we review over 100 studies on the topic and uncover a more complex reality—one that resists a simple technical fix. While we identify key trends and advancements, persistent gaps remain. We argue that there is no simple technical solution to bias. Building on insights from our review, we examine the growing prominence of large language models and discuss the challenges and opportunities they present in the context of gender bias and translation. By doing so, we hope to inspire future work in the field to break with past limitations and to be less focused on a technical fix; more user-centric, multilingual, and multiculturally diverse; more personalized; and better grounded in real-world needs.}

Using opinion-mining method and decision tree analysis, the types of cyberbullying were sorted using SPSS 25.0. The results indicated that the total rate of types of cyberbullying in Korea was 44%, which consisted of 32.3% victims, 6.4% perpetrators, and 5.3% bystanders. According to the results, the impulse factor was also the greatest influence on the prediction of the risk factors and the propensity for dominance factor was the second greatest factor predicting the types of risk factors. In particular, the impulse factor had the most significant effect on bystanders, and the propensity for dominance factor was also significant in influencing online perpetrators. It is necessary to develop a program to diminish the impulses that were initiated by bystanders as well as victims and perpetrators because many of those bystanders have tended to aggravate impulsive cyberbullying behaviors.}

The reviews were extracted and then used for training a sentiment analysis model. The VADER sentiment method was utilized to offer the review's initial labeling (positive, neutral, and negative). The result revealed that most reviews were classified as positive, meaning that the data were imbalanced and challenging to handle in further analysis. Therefore, Random Under-sampling (RUS) and Random Over-sampling (ROS) methods were deployed to deal with that condition. The labeled reviews were subsequently pre-processed using tools such as case folding, noise removal, normalization, and stopwords before being used for training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for sentiment classification. The SVM trained without resampling produced the most favorable results, with an F1-score of 0.80.}

Even though there are numerous literature reviews regarding project communication issues and different aspects of virtual teams, there is no one dedicated specifically to the topic of communication in virtual project teams. Aim – the paper aims to identify the scientific output in the area of communication in virtual project teams from the last 20 years (2001-2020) and analyze it for its volume, geographic distribution, publication types, areas and types of research and contributing authors. Method – a bibliometric approach has been applied to answer the research questions regarding the number of publications in the studied period, most contributing countries and most prolific authors, prevailing publication types and research topics addressed in the studied literature. Three databases – Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were used to search for publications about communication in virtual project teams and the refined results from these databases were combined into the final dataset which was then analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. Contribution – the results of the bibliometric review of research on communication in virtual teams show that the most frequently undertaken topics concern methods and tools for communication in virtual teams, while issues linking communication with trust or leadership are the least explored areas.}

abstract = {With the rapid development in mobile computing and Web technologies, online hate speech has been increasingly spread in social network platforms since it's easy to post any opinions. Previous studies confirm that exposure to online hate speech has serious offline consequences to historically deprived communities. Thus, research on automated hate speech detection has attracted much attention. However, the role of social networks in identifying hate-related vulnerable community is not well investigated. Hate speech can affect all population groups, but some are more vulnerable to its impact than others. For example, for ethnic groups whose languages have few computational resources, it is a challenge to automatically collect and process online texts, not to mention automatic hate speech detection on social media. In this paper, we propose a hate speech detection approach to identify hatred against vulnerable minority groups on social media. Firstly, in Spark distributed processing framework, posts are automatically collected and pre-processed, and features are extracted using word n-grams and word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec. Secondly, deep learning algorithms for classification such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a variety of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are used for hate speech detection. Finally, hate words are clustered with methods such as Word2Vec to predict the potential target ethnic group for hatred. In our experiments, we use Amharic language in Ethiopia as an example. Since there was no publicly available dataset for Amharic texts, we crawled Facebook pages to prepare the corpus. Since data annotation could be biased by culture, we recruit annotators from different cultural backgrounds and achieved better inter-annotator agreement. In our experimental results, feature extraction using word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec performs better in both classical and deep learning-based classification algorithms for hate speech detection, among which GRU achieves the best result. Our proposed approach can successfully identify the Tigre ethnic group as the highly vulnerable community in terms of hatred compared with Amhara and Oromo. As a result, hatred vulnerable group identification is vital to protect them by applying automatic hate speech detection model to remove contents that aggravate psychological harm and physical conflicts. This can also encourage the way towards the development of policies, strategies, and tools to empower and protect vulnerable communities.}

The findings highlighted the most used traditional project management practices, such as kick-off meeting, teamwork, progress meetings, and reports. In contrast, the adoption of newer techniques, like earned value and statistical control charts, was found to be limited employed. While traditional project management techniques remain essential due to the linear nature of workflows in construction, the study suggests that there may be opportunities to integrate newer approaches that emphasize monitoring, analysis, and risk management more effectively.

In addition, this chapter outlines the historical evolution, from public health’s early days focused on premodern quarantines to the 19th century’s early modern vaccines and workplace safety, to the 20th century’s late modern globalization following World War II, and 21st-century global public health as data-driven sustainable development, digitalized and institutionalized by the United Nations, World Health Organization, and related public–private partnerships. This chapter considers the anticolonial and COVID-19 critiques of this process and the current global public health ecosystem, setting the stage for the “Great COVID Reset” to foster a human security–based approach to scale responsible AI globally by respecting diverse identities, agency, and values, locally. This chapter introduces this approach, the Personalist Liberalism, as the person-centered, health-based political economic framework to understand the emergent future of health in the context of our world’s structural power imbalances between peoples, elites, institutions, corporations, and governments. It summarizes these themes and trends amid the emerging primary categories for AI use cases illustrating them, including population health, precision public health, and system optimization, to set the stage for the remainder of the book focusing on the ecosystem’s main constitutive domains. Finally, this chapter outlines the structure of the book—focused on responsible AI reengineering a global public health ecosystem as a common home for all humanity—with these domains as the components of a home: design (financing and integral development), framework (data architecture and political economics), inhabitants (culture and demographics), and foundation (security and ethics).}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as game-changers across industries, revolutionizing various sectors by harnessing extensive text data to analyze and generate human-like text. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs often encounter challenges when dealing with domain-specific queries, potentially leading to inaccuracies in their outputs. In response, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a viable solution. By seamlessly integrating external data retrieval into text generation processes, RAG aims to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the generated content. However, existing literature reviews tend to focus primarily on the technological advancements of RAG, overlooking a comprehensive exploration of its applications. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a thorough review of RAG applications, encompassing both task-specific and discipline-specific studies, while also outlining potential avenues for future research. By shedding light on current RAG research and outlining future directions, this review aims to catalyze further exploration and development in this dynamic field, thereby contributing to ongoing digital transformation efforts.}

The opportunities for prosperity and sustainable development offered by Electronic Payment Systems (EPS) are of great interest to both authorities and various stakeholders, especially in developing countries. Needless to say, UTAUT2 explains only 40 % of the actual use's variance. This model lacks certain salient constructs that have proven to be relevant. Based on 41 reviewed articles, this current paper aims to provide an innovative model built on robust theoretical foundations, including two new concepts Contextual Acquaintance that encompasses experience, familiarity, and situational normality, and Overall Reliability which gathers consistency of the technology itself and stakeholders’ reliability. This led us to uncover new endogenous mechanisms without burdening the model with multiple variables. Furthermore, this model incorporates for the first time horizontal and vertical dimensions of collectivism and individualism in the context of EPS adoption, providing a more profound understanding of behaviors in multicultural societies. Finally, this paper provides a research framework for scholars to reduce the redundancies observed in this context.}

Until the last twenty years, young people have traditionally met their information needs through reading. It was formed as a result of long historical traditions. There has always been a significant difference between "heard information" and "read information". The percentage of "read information" by young people with higher education should have been higher than the percentage of "listened to information". This percentage determined the intelligence of the young man and expressed his social and cultural qualities. Surveys show that young people spend "time reading" on the Internet and are content with getting "episodic" information instead of classical reading. Also, reading is not one of the main activities in the organization of leisure. Here, too, the main place is occupied by the Internet. Over the past twenty years, the “time” spent on the Internet has been growing dynamically and is crowding out various traditional activities for young people. Students of the Azerbaijan State University of Culture and Arts created a working group to study the classical reading skills of young people, conducted surveys and obtained interesting results. To study the classic reading habits of young people belonging to different categories, and to compare the results obtained, it is necessary to have certain standards and norms. Unfortunately, although the results are not comparable with other regions, in a country with a population of ten million and 54 universities, the attitude of young people towards classical reading reveals a certain pattern.}

The boosted NNE collections based ensemble classifier involves three steps: first is the training of binary neural networks, second is to combine the predictions of binary neural networks to form NNE, and third is to combine the predictions of NNE collections in order to detect the presence of an expression. The results of binary neural networks are tied to the probability value across the NNE collection. The boosting technique is applied for the construction of NNEs and the final prediction is made by Naive Bayes classifier. The Voila–Jones algorithm [1] employed for the detection of face and facial expression concentration region. The acted still images from three databases JAFFE, TFEID, and RadBoud originate from four different cultural and ethnic regions including Japanese, Taiwanese, Caucasians and Moroccans are combined to develop the cross cultural facial expression dataset. This cross cultural facial expression dataset is used for the training and testing of binary neural networks in each NNE collection. Three different feature extraction techniques PCA, LBP and HOG are used for sample image representation. The experimental results and statistical analysis of proposed approach for multicultural facial expression recognition constitute the contribution to the field.}

It is essential to explore the breastfeeding experiences of immigrant women who are vulnerable and often lack adequate breastfeeding support in a new country. This study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 on the breastfeeding practices of immigrant mothers in Saskatchewan, Canada. This critical ethnographic study was undertaken during the second and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. After seeking approval from the ethics review board, in-depth interviews were undertaken with 30 immigrant mothers with a young child aged 1 day to 24 months. Participants were recruited from different cities in Saskatchewan, Canada. Data from in-depth interviews were triangulated with information gathered through field observations and a review of media reports. Data were analyzed manually by the researcher and patient partners on this project. Multiple steps were followed to analyze data inductively and iteratively. Data analysis involved isolation of codes, comparison and validation of codes, identification of categories specifying both positive and negative effects of COVID-19, and derivation of the broad themes reflecting the effects of COVID-19 on breastfeeding practices of immigrant mothers. Interpretations drawn from the data were verified with the study participants. The findings suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic has both positive and negative effects on the breastfeeding practices of immigrant women who are mothering. Key themes derived from the findings include quality time with an infant, lack of support and isolation, limited healthcare access and lactation counselling, mother-baby separation, healthcare restrictions and financial instability. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to promote, protect and support breastfeeding of immigrant women facing add-on challenges due to limited social support, isolation, and financial instability in a new country. This study provides unique insight that can make a difference moving forward by highlighting the adjustments that need to be made in healthcare practices for immigrant women to have a more positive breastfeeding experience in a future pandemic.}

Therefore, this article studies the intelligent recommendation system for English teaching course videos based on machine learning. Firstly, the relevant theories of machine learning were analyzed, and the multiple linear regression, recurrent neural network algorithms, and logistic regression models in machine learning technology were analyzed. At the same time, Markov decision processes are also used to reinforce machine learning algorithms. Secondly, an English teaching video recommendation platform was established to analyze the regional preference and style preference in the field of video recommendation. Finally, an English course recommendation system was developed through the video recommendation technology of machine learning and the current situation of English teaching courses, which can promote the innovation and application of English teaching models.}

Therefore, using a quantitative study approach, this paper investigates the impact of differences in cultural background on perceived technical and operational barriers to iGOAL. Our study reveals six barriers to IGC that are perceived differently by culturally diverse people (CDP) and non-CDP. Furthermore, CDP can foster IGC because CDP consider the barriers to be of less of a reason to avoid working with different generations than do non-CDP.}

In recent years, some pioneering works have shown that users’ intrinsic characteristics, such as personality traits, can help improve the performance of recommender systems. However, they generally do not consider how to obtain users’ personality traits effectively without burdensome surveys and, therefore, cannot be used in new application domains without adequate personality information. Therefore, we propose a novel framework for building cross-domain personality-based recommender systems, especially for personality-scarce target domains. Specifically, we define the cross-domain personality trait classification problem and solve it in a semisupervised manner by leveraging the predictive text embedding method as the method for transfer learning from the source to the target domain. We then design a personality-boosted probabilistic matrix factorization method for personality-based recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that users’ personality traits can be recognized more precisely with cross-domain transfer learning, and recommendation performance is improved accordingly.}

Research suggests that extremists use social media for reaching their purposes like recruitment, fund raising, and propaganda. Limited research is available to identify rebel users on social media platforms. Therefore, we propose a Supervised Rebel Identification (SRI) framework to identify rebels on Twitter. The framework consists of a novel mechanism to structure the users’ tweets into a directed user graph. This user graph links predicates (verbs) with the subject and object words to understand semantics of the underlying data. We convert the user graph into graph embedding to use these semantics within the machine learning algorithms. Apart from the user graph and its embedding, we propose fourteen other features belonging to tweets’ contents and users’ profiles. For evaluation, we present the first multicultural and multiregional dataset of rebels affiliated with nine rebel movements belonging to five countries. We evaluate the proposed SRI framework against two state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that the SRI framework outperforms the baselines with high accuracy.}

Project managers must be aware of these factors and create an environment that fosters effective collaboration and trust. Tuckman’s model for group development consists of five stages: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. A lack of trust among team members can prevent a team from becoming a high-performance team. Research has shown a correlation between high-performance teams and GLOBE’s cultural dimensions. GLOBE, short for "Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness," is a large-scale research program that explores cultural variations in leadership and organizational behavior. The cultural context and its impact on team dynamics can help organizations create more effective and high-performing teams. Trust is a key component of team performance and can lead to improved communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. In the oil and gas sector, multidisciplinary projects often involve complex engineering and technical challenges, so it is essential to have a team that is skilled, experienced, and focused on project success. The goal of this research is to investigate the influence of cultural dimensions and social behavior on project team success and to explore the role of trust in fostering effective collaboration and creating a high-performance team. The research approach employed in this study was secondary data analysis, utilizing existing data to address the research questions. This study found that cultural dimensions and social behavior significantly influence project team success. Trust plays a key role, and Tuckman’s model highlights its importance for high-performance teams. Overall, the results of this study provide insights and guidance for organizations to navigate cultural diversity, build trust, and enhance team performance. Implementing these findings can lead to improved project outcomes, stronger collaboration, and increased organizational effectiveness in various industries and sectors.

In this paper, we've conducted a systematic literature review so as to explore the main digital skills which enhance project managers’ efficiency. By analyzing the main extracted concepts from the papers resulting from our systematic literature review, we've concluded that adopting digital skills is as important as technical classic project management skills and soft skills. Also, we've performed a quantitative assessment of the 15 selected articles by using bibliometric tools. Indeed, our clustering analysis on the selected papers confirms the rise of digitals skills importance since the Covid19 pandemic. In light of the above, we believe that adopting and mastering digital skills is a requirement for current project managers in order to succeed in a changing and volatile environment. Digital skills will undoubtedly play a central role for project managers to stand out and thrive in this new normal.}

Existing approaches for modeling opinion dynamics mostly do not take into account the dynamism of social relations in a group. This paper proposes an algorithm and a program based on it, which allows modeling opinion dynamics considering that the strength of the connection, i.e. the probability of the next contact between two given group members depends on the result of their current communication. As an example, the paper presents the dynamics of opinions and the corresponding dynamics of the strength of bonds for a group of 100 people. With an initial uniform distribution of opinion values, over 50 cycles of interaction the group arrives at an equilibrium state with three subgroups that have opinion values as far apart as possible. The graphs of link dynamics show the formation of stable subgroups as early as after 5 cycles of interaction. The applicability of this model approach to a number of areas of applied and fundamental research is discussed.}

abstract = {Travel location recommendation systems have long been used by travellers for their ability to suggest destinations and potential travel experiences that match travellers' desires. Recently, a new type of domestic travel has emerged, namely domestic overseas-like travel experiences. These experiences are attractive to travellers who have a preference for exotic locations but no desire to travel internationally. Existing travel recommendation systems were not designed for such applications, nor do they have the relevant ability to recommend domestic overseas-like travel experiences to support travel decision making. To address this challenge, this paper focuses on the development of a recommendation model based on the visual content of photos for domestic overseas-like travel experiences and a prototype application. The application uses the latest advancement in computer vision — the concept model — to learn high-level concepts in an overseas travel destination photo collection to identify similar domestic travel experiences. We demonstrate the usability of the prototype application with a large-scale data set of approximately 479,000 travel photos taken in several countries and evaluate its utility and efficacy through four focus groups with target users.}

A novel deep-learning model has been developed to produce precise synthetic lip movements corresponding to the speech extracted from an audio source. Consequently, there are instances where portions of the visual data may fall out of sync with the updated audio and this challenge is handled through, a novel strategy, leveraging insights from a robust lip-sync discriminator. Additionally, this study introduces fresh criteria and evaluation benchmarks for assessing lip synchronization in unconstrained videos. LipChanger demonstrates improved PSNR values, indicative of enhanced image quality. Furthermore, it exhibits highly accurate lip synthesis, as evidenced by lower LMD values and higher SSIM values. These outcomes suggest that the LipChanger approach holds significant potential for enhancing lip synchronization in talking face videos, resulting in more realistic lip movements. The proposed LipChanger model and its associated evaluation benchmarks show promise and could potentially contribute to advancements in lip-sync technology for unconstrained talking face videos.}

The relevant body of games and human–computer interaction oriented literature has grown considerably. However, the research is highly diverse and multidisciplinary, and reviews on live-streaming research are missing. In this article, we explore the current research on influencing factors in live-streaming, to identify the state of the field and inform future research. A scoping review was conducted to map the currently researched topics and factors, to find emerging or understudied topics, and to analyze the state of multidisciplinary and multicultural cooperation. Two iterations of a literature search and a citation-based literature mapping were used to collect 348 peer-reviewed entries. Identified and classified themes were analyzed along with visualizations of the local citation network, concept co-occurrence, and an inter-country citation graph. As a result, the main actors, genres, and issues in live-streaming, the frequency with which they are researched, and their trends over time were identified and described. Games and esports dominate research; topics recently gaining interest are e-commerce, mental health, collaboration and teaching using streams, and promoting tourism using streams. The body of literature is well connected; scientific disciplines and research groups seem to be aware of each other. For future research, we recommend exploring non-gaming genres and hybrid events and pursuing interdisciplinary collaboration.}

This research tests contact-hypothesis predictions and two CMC theories on multicultural, virtual groups who communicated during a yearlong online course focusing on educational technology. Groups included students from the three major Israeli education sectors—religious Jews, secular Jews, and Muslims—who completed pretest and posttest prejudice measures. Two sets of control subjects who did not participate in virtual groups provided comparative data. An interaction of the virtual groups experience×religious/cultural membership affected prejudice toward different religious/cultural target groups, by reducing prejudice toward the respective outgroups for whom the greatest initial enmity existed. Comparisons of virtual group participants to control subjects further support the influence of the online experience. Correlations between prejudice with group identification and with interpersonal measures differentiate which theoretical processes pertained.}

Product images, a vital aspect of the system interface, play a significant role in shaping users' first impressions, facilitating seller-buyer information interaction, and ultimately enhancing users' decisions making in the system. Across a series of studies, this research investigates the effect of cultural differences (thinking style: holistic vs. analytic) on image background and reveals the underlying mechanism. Results show that online consumers from cultures characterized by holistic thinking style (Chinese sample) are more prone to purchase products presented with contextual backgrounds than those with white backgrounds, while this effect is absent for online consumers from cultures that tend to think in an analytic way (American sample). This effect is also observed when the thinking style is primed within the culture in separate samples from the United States and China. Study 3 employs eye-tracking technology and shows that holistic thinking, compared to analytic thinking, results in an asymmetry in cognitive effort to purchase the same products framed with contextual and white background images. Specifically, contextual (vs. white) background information greatly assists holistic thinking consumers in understanding the product, enabling them to spend less cognitive effort on product information processing. Instead, the cognitive effort that analytic thinking consumers spare in the product information is not affected by the background. Finally, we discuss theoretical contributions and practical insights for CBEC retailers and system designers that the findings indicate.}

The Bob game provide users with general culture questions from the geography field, more specifically related to cities, countries, and lakes. The questions are formed by extracting and analyzing information from two major knowledge sources, DBpedia and Wikidata, both massively used in the natural language processing field. Bob can initiate general culture tests, during which questions will be automatically adapted to the knowledge level of the player through Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT). Following user specified settings, Bob also offers the possibility to rank players according to their performance and to post Twitter statistics on request. One major advantage of our solution comes from the fact that the application can be used through Amazon Echo or through a smartphone, allowing the child to access it from home or from any place with Internet connection.}

In the 21st century, the change from the industrial society to a knowledge society has been consolidated, but it has not involved a disruption in the learning context. Some elements, many based on technologies, can be considered disruptive, but they have not had sufficient effect to produce a change in the model that has predominated for 300 years. In 2008, teachers began to offer training outside the walls of the university, with a totally disruptive and chaotic model compared to the traditional one; this was supported by open, informal, cooperative, connectivist, autonomous and self-guided training. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) began with cMOOCs, and most universities join the initiative, but they abandoned this disruption, ultimately offering the same courses they always had with free access for anyone, resulting in the second generation of MOOCs (xMOOCs). These MOOCs responded to a new social demand, but their characteristics and context make a formative disruption – which has not yet emerged – necessary. This paper analyses the elements of the two generations of MOOCs in order to propose a new model that does not require sophisticated technological solutions and recovers the initial disruptive sense of MOOCs, so called ahMOOC. It also presents a case study that integrates the social advantages of cMOOCs, the organisational benefits of xMOOCs and the personalisation of the learning, which is essential due to the heterogeneity of the participants. The results and the participant viewpoints emerging from the case study confirm the feasibility of the model, the improvement of the results of current MOOCs and the need – demanded by the participants – to consider diversity, all of which should be accomplished in a disruptive way.}

To this end, this study integrates natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis technologies to propose innovative solutions: by constructing a multilingual text corpus covering news, social media, literature and other genres, it can completely restore the characteristics of global language use; The deep learning model is used to train the corpus to achieve accurate recognition of multilingual emotional tendencies, metaphorical expressions and culturally specific vocabulary. On this basis, automatic translation and content adjustment tools are developed, and on the premise of retaining the semantics of the original text, the symbol replacement (avoiding negative associations) and tone adaptation (conforming to local expression habits) are fine-tuned for the target culture. After field testing in multicultural areas and a large number of feedback data collection, the results showed that the acceptance of the optimized cross-cultural content in the target culture was significantly improved—the positive emotional feedback rate increased by 32 % on average, and the cultural misreading rate decreased by 19 %. This empirical evidence fully validates the great potential of NLP and sentiment analysis technology in enhancing the adaptability of cross-cultural communication.}

It considers global population aging with the consensus projections of demographic decline and even collapse in multiple regions of the Global North (especially in China, Japan, South Korea, and Europe) along with the demographic surge in the Global South (especially in Africa), and how these trends are accompanied by the accelerated health and financial burden of noncommunicable diseases, disproportionately straining low-income countries with decreasing resources from the aging North to assist. It additionally considers how 20th-century decolonization increasingly gave way to early 21st-century development and finally to 2010s–2020s and onward emphasis on multicultural diversity and biodiversity. This most recent phase seeks to advance equity and sovereignty along with global health to consider traditionally underrepresented voices in the ethics and values underlying governance in global public health. Finally, this chapter considers the growing importance of human security to bound national security concerns. This chapter therefore considers the centrality of this approach within Personalist Social Contract ethics, embedded in Political Liberalism political economics—beyond the overly simplified distinction of democracies versus autocracies—before applying it to concrete challenges and emergent solutions in the AI ethics of the global public health ecosystem. The challenges include the risks of AI including global inequities, technical weaponization, political destabilization (through social media misinformation), economic centralization, societal enfeeblement, and superintelligence (with up to existential risks for humanity). It also considers the challenges of generating and enforcing robust and sustainable consensus-based AI ethics for health amid superficial principle proliferation. This chapter outlines early responses including with the World Health Organization AI ethical principles, and then uses the Personalist Social Contract to show further advances (including in foundational work in AI existentialism) and real-time application (including defending global consensus on human dignity, rights, and sovereignty as in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, facilitating moral interoperability across the diverse sectors, states, and belief systems constituting the global public health ecosystem). Finally, this chapter illustrates the above in dialogue with African Ubuntu and global embodiment in the global village of our common home.}

The purpose of this research is to apply social network analysis to map students' social activities. Using large-scale data on students' participation in social events at a major public university, we illustrate how to use social network analysis to visualize the social fabric of the student body as a whole and to explore the interwoven and isolated social clusters at the core and the periphery of students’ extracurricular activities. We explain how such findings can be used to inform university policies aimed at increasing social inclusion.}

This research presents a dynamic process of cultural alignment, outlining the steps and events that lead to the alignment of cultural issues between an ERP system and the adopting organization at national, sectoral, organizational and group levels. Drawing on a longitudinal case study of a logistics service provider’s ERP system deployment across France, Italy, Morocco and Tunisia, this study shows that cultural alignment involves four key steps – requirement analysis, ERP selection, cultural misfit resolution and user testing – that are strongly influenced by technical, operational and organizational constraints.

abstract = {The strong connection between technologies and globalization has made the phenomenon of interculturality increase at a global level. The aim was to determine the perception of teachers and students in the use of a Model of Talent Management for interculturality. A virtual learning environment (VLE) was used to link teachers and students of 5 schools in disadvantaged context of Chile through collaborative learning. The research is interpretive and positivist based on qualitative method approach, with quantitative contributions. Results show that talents of the students contribute to the formation of cultural identity that gives uniqueness to the human group to which they belong and the perception of teachers is that the phenomena of acculturation, enculturation and transculturation processes occur in learning linked to the management of the talents of students in intercultural contexts. With respect to the proposed model, trends indicate that it is possible to diagnose and promote talent through collaborative learning and intercultural dialogue. As for technology, it could be argued that it has reshaped relations between different cultures.}

abstract = {Background
The remote, dispersed, and multicultural population of Canada presents unique challenges for health care services. Currently, virtual care solutions are being offered as an innovative solution to improve access to care.
Objective
Given the inequities in health care access faced by immigrant, refugee, and Indigenous Canadians, this review aimed to summarize information obtained from original research regarding these people’s experiences with virtual care services in Canada.
Methods
We conducted a rapid review following published recommendations. MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for studies relating to virtual care and Canadian immigrants, refugees, or Indigenous peoples. Peer-reviewed articles of any type were included so long as they included information on the experiences of virtual care service delivery in Canada among the abovementioned groups.
Results
This review demonstrates an extreme paucity of evidence examining the experiences of immigrant, refugee, and Indigenous groups with virtual care in Canada. Of the 694 publications screened, 8 were included in this review. A total of 2 studies focused on immigrants and refugees in Canada, with the remaining studies focusing on Indigenous communities. Results demonstrate that virtual care is generally accepted within these communities; however, cultural appropriateness or safety and inequitable access to wireless services in certain communities were among the most cited barriers.
Conclusions
Little evidence exists outlining immigrants’, refugees’, and Indigenous peoples’ perspectives on the landscape of virtual care in Canada. The development of virtual care programming should take into consideration the barriers, facilitators, and recommendations outlined in this review to improve equitable access. Further, developers should consult with local community members to ensure the appropriateness of services for immigrant, refugee, and Indigenous communities in Canada.}

Since there is no effective pharmacological treatment, country’s governments are looking for policies and strategies, which would delay the aging process, and thus prolong an active life of aging population. One of these policies appears to be the use of technologies, respectively mobile applications, by elderly people. The purpose of this article is to discuss the use of mobile applications in learning foreign languages, such as English, by elderly people, as well as their benefits. Overall, mobile apps for learning a foreign language appear to be one of the tools which can promote well-being of older people. The results reveal there are many benefits of learning a foreign language by seniors. These include, for example, improvement of their cognitive performance, positive impact on their psyche, reduction of anxiety, gaining self-confidence, development of new social ties and feeling of self-realization, as well as learning of a new foreign language. However, research in this area is very scare, which is due to the lack of such apps for the elderly and consequently, due to the lack of the experimental studies in this field.}

In particular, knowing that AI-MC tools are used by the communicator might reduce recipients' perceptions of the authenticity of emotionally charged messages, such as an apology. Across three scenario-based studies rooted in an interpersonal work-related conflict, we examined the effects of the choice to use AI-MC tools to communicate an apology, focusing on people's perceptions of the genuineness of the apology, and their ensuing tendency to forgive the person apologizing. We consistently found that the choice to use AI-MC tools diminished perceptions of the apology's authenticity and the consequent willingness to forgive, and that self-disclosing the use of AI-MC on the part of the communicator did not mitigate this effect. However, making limited use of AI-MC (selecting to use only one of three available tools) had no negative impact on the perceived authenticity of the apology, suggesting that limiting the use of AI-MC signals a diminished distance between the original intention of the person apologizing and the final formulation of the message of apology, leading to perceptions of a more genuine apology.}

abstract = {Background
The increasing prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among women of different ethnic backgrounds provides new challenges for health care professionals, who often find it difficult to provide information about the management of this disease to such individuals. Mobile health (mHealth) may act as a useful tool for blood sugar control and care process enhancement. However, little is known about health care professionals’ experiences and attitudes toward the use of mHealth for women with GDM.
Objective
The aim of this study was to explore how health care professionals perceived the provision of care to pregnant women who managed their GDM using the culture-sensitive Pregnant+ app in a randomized controlled trial.
Methods
Individual interviews with 9 health care professionals providing care for women with GDM were conducted. Braun and Clark’s method of thematic content analysis inspired the analysis. This study included health care professionals who were primarily responsible for providing care to participants with GDM in the Pregnant+ randomized controlled trial at 5 diabetes outpatient clinics in Oslo, Norway.
Results
Health care professionals perceived mHealth, particularly the Pregnant+ app, as an appropriate tool for the care of women with GDM, who were described as individuals comprising a heterogeneous, motivated group that could be easily approached with health-related information. Some participants reported challenges with respect to provision of advice to women with different food cultures. The advantages of the Pregnant+ app included provision of information that women could access at home, the information provided being perceived as trustworthy by health care professionals, the culture sensitivity of the app, and the convenience for women to register blood sugar levels. Technical problems, particularly those associated with the automatic transfer of blood glucose measurements, were identified as the main barrier to the use of the Pregnant+ app. Strict inclusion criteria and the inclusion of participants who could not speak Norwegian were the main challenges in the recruitment process for the randomized controlled trial.
Conclusions
The findings of this study suggest that mHealth is a useful tool to enhance the care provided by health care professionals to women with GDM. Future mobile apps for the management of GDM should be developed by a trustworthy source and in cooperation with health care professionals. They should also be culture sensitive and should not exhibit technical problems.}

Second, there is a lack of empirical studies capturing real-world data from industry relating to cultural intelligence in global projects. Third, it is unclear what correlation, if any, there is between leaders’ characteristics and their level of cultural intelligence. To address these deficits, this study aims to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) for cultural intelligence in intercultural communication in the context of global projects and investigate the relationships between leader’s characteristics and their level of cultural intelligence. Data were collected and analyzed from 85 project leaders currently working in a global multinational corporation (MNC) in Europe, Middle East, and Asia (EMEA). The findings confirm that emotional intelligence, personality, and openness to learning, communication and empathy are key to cultural intelligence in complex multicultural environments. The results advance our understanding of the antecedents to cultural intelligence and present actionable insights for companies.}

Nonetheless, the Sarawak State Government had deployed the Sarawak Digital Economy Strategy 2018-2022 blueprint as one of their initiatives to position Sarawak as a high-income state. To boost Sarawak's Digital Economy, promoting and implementing eCommerce is crucial. Yet, the key challenge lies in ensuring full acceptance and adoption of this transformative approach by all stakeholders. Therefore, this research was carried out to offer valuable insights to the state government regarding the factors that influence the sustainability of current eCommerce platforms in Sarawak. The date collected from Sarawakians served as the foundation for this study. Data from 130 individuals residing in Sarawak was collected through e-survey, employing a quantitative research method. The findings indicate that the sustainability of an eCommerce platform in Sarawak is influenced by the extent to which it aids users in achieving their objectives. Additionally, the Sarawak community's awareness of the advantages and risks associated with using eCommerce platforms was identified as another factor impacting platform sustainability. In summary, this study highlights significant factors that can contribute to the development of Sarawak's Digital Economy. By identifying these variables, it provides valuable insights that can serve as a call to action for the state government.}

This paper contributes to quantitative research in the Airbnb sector by focusing on the integration of digital platform data at the neighborhood level. It explores innovative methodologies for analyzing urban attractiveness by combining insights from hedonic pricing models with large-scale digital data sourced through AI-based approaches. This novel framework compares user-based valuations of accommodations derived from hedonic pricing with subjective, AI-generated neighborhood descriptions, offering new perspectives on data quality and reliability in information systems. The study also critically examines the challenges of integrating AI-generated content in information science, referencing also ‘Garbage-in Garbage-out’ and ‘Bullshit-in Bullshit-out’ concepts. Employing a multi-scalar modeling approach, the research examines Airbnb pricing dynamics across several U.S. cities, starting with Manhattan (USA) as an illustrative case. A subsequent large-scale application to additional metropolitan areas utilizes a combination of hedonic price modeling, social media data, and AI-generated urban descriptions, including a Shapley decomposition analysis. This interdisciplinary integration provides actionable insights into neighborhood attractiveness and pricing mechanisms, while highlighting methodological and empirical contributions to the broader field of information management. By employing the relationship between AI-driven textual data and quantitative modeling, this research provides added value in analyzing urban information systems and their application to digital platforms.}

It summarizes the key findings for these domains from the earlier chapters while highlighting emblematic AI case uses. It considers financing advances, including in universal health coverage, public–private partnerships, digital global health diplomacy, finance tracking, and value-based health. This chapter moves on to integral sustainable development advances, including in AI for the sustainable development goals, precision agriculture, climate change, affordable clean energy, equity, and generative AI (including ChatGPT). It then considers data architecture advances, including in the United Kingdom’s hybrid data architecture, India’s federated data architecture, swarm learning, gossip learning, blockchain, edge computing, application programming interfaces, augmented public health intelligence, quantum computing, zero-trust security, blockchain, and data solidarity. This chapter then considers political economic advances particularly from the perspective of Political Liberalism–bridging democracies and autocracies, including in data governance models (spanning Europe’s general data protection regulation and Japan’s agile governance), managed strategic competition, and World Health Organization coordination. Finally, this chapter considers AI ethics for the health ecosystem. Particular emphasis is given to how population aging, multicultural diversity, and human security requires more inclusive discussion of diverse perspectives, as through Personalist Social Contract ethics to generate and sustain substantive convergence on the unifying values of human dignity, rights, and sovereignty that then give rise to effective and equitable collective action. This chapter concludes by applying the abovesaid dimensions to concrete AI use cases for the global public health ecosystem that illustrates this integral approach, including ethics by design or embedded AI ethics (within existing ecosystem operations and structures), democratizing AI or personalizing AI (as with end-to-end AI platforms and edge computing expanding and interlinking free and affordable AI services for larger audiences), and ecosystem interoperability (uniting political economic interoperability, data interoperability, and moral interoperability to leverage global resources and insights for local communities leading their own projects).}

abstract = {Background
Several tools have been developed for health care professionals to monitor the physical activity of their patients, but most of these tools have been considering only the needs of users in North American and European countries and applicable for only specific analytic tasks. To our knowledge, no research study has utilized the participatory design (PD) approach in the Middle East region to develop such tools, involving all the stakeholders in the product development phases, and no clear use cases have been derived from such studies that could serve future development in the field.
Objective
This study aims to develop an interactive visualization tool (ActiVis) to support local health care professionals in monitoring the physical activity of their patients measured through wearable sensors, with the overall objective of improving the health of the Qatari population.
Methods
We used PD and user-centered design methodologies to develop ActiVis, including persona development, brainwriting, and heuristic walkthrough as part of user evaluation workshops; and use cases, heuristic walkthrough, interface walkthrough, and survey as part of expert evaluation sessions.
Results
We derived and validated 6 data analysis use cases targeted at specific health care professionals from a collaborative design workshop and an expert user study. These use cases led to improving the design of the ActiVis tool to support the monitoring of patients’ physical activity by nurses and family doctors. The ActiVis research prototype (RP) compared favorably with the Fitbit Dashboard, showing the importance of design tools specific to end users’ needs rather than relying on repurposing existing tools designed for other types of users. The use cases we derived happen to be culturally agnostic, despite our assumption that the local Muslim and Arabic culture could impact the design of such visualization tools. At last, taking a step back, we reflect on running collaborative design sessions in a multicultural environment and oil-based economy.
Conclusions
Beyond the development of the ActiVis tool, this study can serve other visualization and human–computer interaction designers in the region to prepare their design projects and encourage health care professionals to engage with designers and engineers to improve the tools they use for supporting their daily routine. The development of the ActiVis tool for nurses, and other visualization tools specific to family doctors and clinician researchers, is still ongoing and we plan to integrate them into an operational platform for health care professionals in Qatar in the near future.}

The retention rate is positively and negatively influenced by factors belonging to several dimensions (personal, environmental, and institutional). We aim to use information from those dimensions to identify students enrolled in a Computer Networks course at risk of failing the subject. Besides, this needs to happen as early as possible, to be able to provide the students, for example, with extra support or resources to try to prevent that negative outcome. For predicting the grade level on the first test, the best accuracy obtained was 55%. However, most C-level grades were correctly classified, with 63% accuracy in predicting the students that are most at risk of failing, which is one of our main objectives. As for the prediction of the second test’s grade level, the best accuracy obtained was 89% and concerned data regarding the students’ interaction with the LMS together with students’ grades history. All the C-level grades were correctly classified (100% accuracy) and so we were able to correctly predict every student at a high risk of failing. Using the procedure described in this paper, we are able to anticipate the students needing extra support, and provide them with different resources, to try to prevent their negative outcome.}

The field of child-computer interaction has long paid attention to DEI issues, but primarily from the perspective of empowering children to have voices in design or in the inclusion of children with disabilities; far less emphasis has been placed on issues of racial bias or systemic oppression. However, as more researchers heed the call to examine racial DEI in design contexts, others voice concerns that such an emphasis is a political issue that we should not focus on. In this paper, I take the former position, addressing this argument from the perspective of a Latina immigrant who grew up in Black, Brown, and immigrant spaces and attended low-income schools with a majority Black/Brown population. I do so to help my colleagues, especially those outside the United States, understand why racial DEI is critical in fields responsible for designing for children and empowering the next generation of design innovators. Towards this aim, I provide an accounting of the lived experiences of children of color in educational spaces and the harm they experience every day in formal and informal learning spaces. I then close the paper by providing six principles for the creation of child-centered empowerment in technological design spaces that we can use to mitigate many of the issues I raise.}

keywords = {intimate partner violence, mHealth, attitudes, midwives, prenatal care},
abstract = {Background
Violence against women is considered a global health problem, and intimate partner violence (IPV) around the time of childbirth can have severe consequences for mother and child. Prenatal care is considered a window of opportunity to address IPV and ask women about exposure to violence since women are in regular contact with health care providers. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions might overcome the barriers to talking about IPV face-to-face.
Objective
Our objective was to explore midwives’ attitudes toward a tablet intervention consisting of information about IPV and safety behaviors as well as their experiences with recruiting pregnant women of different ethnic backgrounds in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
Methods
Individual interviews were conducted with 9 midwives who recruited participants for an RCT to test a video to promote safety behaviors delivered on a tablet during prenatal care. Analysis was guided by thematic analysis.
Results
Midwives perceived the tablet intervention as an appropriate supplement during prenatal care to provide information about IPV and promote safety behaviors. They participated in the RCT primarily to obtain more knowledge regarding how to communicate about IPV. The intervention was perceived as an anonymous door-opener to talk about IPV and a good solution to ensure that every woman gets the same information. However, the content of the intervention had to be trustworthy and align with the information the midwives provide to women. Given the sensitivity of IPV, midwives outlined the importance of following the intervention with face-to-face communication. Midwives reported technical problems and a high demand on their time as the main challenges to recruiting women. They experienced challenges recruiting women of different ethnic backgrounds due to linguistic barriers and the women’s skepticism about scientific research.
Conclusions
The tablet intervention might help midwives communicate about IPV. Although the video was considered as an anonymous door-opener to talk about IPV, midwives outlined the importance of following the intervention with face-to-face communication. The scarcity of midwives’ time during consultations has to be considered when implementing the intervention. Further research is needed to overcome barriers that limit inclusion of women from different ethnic backgrounds.

A total of 113 adult consumers participated in a laboratory experiment where they were asked to evaluate either of two experimental websites, one with Hispanic cultural connotations and the other with American cultural meanings. Their SNS usage and cultural orientations were measured. It was found that more frequent usage of Spanish SNS was significantly associated with a higher level of Hispanic cultural orientation and a more favorable attitude toward the website with American cultural meanings. However, the use of English SNS did not significantly influence people's American cultural orientations and their website evaluations. Usage of both Spanish and English SNS was found to be motivated by individuals' social play dependency on such media platforms.}

Distinct geographic patterns have been emerging in how people vote for political parties at federal elections in Australia. The application of GIS is demonstrated using the results of the 2004 federal election. A Web-accessed GIS-enabled database to map the patterns of voter support for political parties at the local level of polling booths is developed. The socioeconomic factors which explain the variations across the polling booths in levels of support for all political parties in the nation’s federal electorates are identified. A statistical model is used to predict the different spatial patterns of political party’s voting dominance. Finally, GIS tools are used to map those places across Australia that are the heartlands of voter support for the Coalition parties and for the Labor Party and to identify those local areas which are highly marginal where the gap between the primary vote for the government and the opposition is small.}

These models, praised as reservoirs of collective human knowledge, provoke an important question: Do they genuinely reflect the value preferences embraced by different cultures? We measure value alignment by simulating sociological surveys and comparing the distribution of preferences from model responses to human references. We introduce a diversity-enhancement framework featuring a novel memory simulation mechanism, which enables the generation of model preference distributions and captures the diversity and uncertainty inherent in LLM behaviors through realistic survey experiments. To better understand the causes of misalignment, we have developed comprehensive evaluation metrics. Our analysis of multilingual survey data illustrates that our framework improves the reliability of cultural value alignment assessments and captures the complexity of model responses across cultural contexts. Among the eleven models evaluated, the Mistral and Llama-3 series show superior alignment with cultural values, with Mistral-series models notably excelling in comprehending these values in both U.S. and Chinese contexts.11https://github.com/alexc-l/DEF-Survey-Sim.}
