abstract = {Previous research and initiatives in participatory design (PD) with children has focused on co-located participation, leaving a paucity in theoretical and empirical work on geographically distributed on-line co-design with children. This gap presents a unique opportunity for children across the globe to become co-designers of their own digital inclusive learning environment. From a political perspective we strive for a pluriversal design of a hybrid distributed participatory design space using a transcultural approach. Thus in this paper we literally push boundaries in PD as (1) we reflect on two exploratory studies where we engaged children from Finland together with ”underrepresented children in PD”, namely from Namibia and Malaysia, thereby contributing to pluriversality; (2) we expand the concept of transcultural competencies in digital design inspired through co-designing with mixed groups of children from different geographical locations; (3) we raise practical issues requiring attention and further research, namely team building considering goals, social relations, skills and roles of participating children, facilitation goals and challenges, and technologies to enable conducive geographically distributed co-design.}

abstract = {Online disclosure of sexual violence victimisation is a relatively new phenomenon. While prior research has mainly relied on analysis of Twitter data from the #MeToo period, this study compares such disclosures across platforms over two years. Using machine learning, 2927 disclosures were identified for quantitative content analysis and multiple correspondence analysis. Online platforms differed in timing of the posts, information shared, information density, co-occurrence of information and the length of the disclosure message. Most disclosures were found on the platform Twitter, and during the #MeToo movement. These posts differ from disclosures on other platforms and outside the viral movement. Regarding the content, across all platforms and periods, clustering was found around offender-oriented information, making the offender an explicit part of the experience. This study shows that an exclusive focus on online disclosures on Twitter and during viral movements gives a biased and incomplete picture of what online disclosure of sexual victimisation entails. Our cross-platform analysis over time allows for more universal statements about the content and context of online disclosures of sexual victimisation.}

The VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) in Engineering Education has to be observed, studied, analysed and reformed and that too very soon. Higher Education is unable to evolve in pace with the technological developments, global economics, and digital transformations. Global networking has shrunk the world and established inter-connectedness breaking barriers of language, geography, societal cultures, and perceptions. However such rapid changes have not impacted Engineering Education much. Academicians prophecies about attributes that an engineer should possess are turning volatile. This uncertainty leads to unemployed engineers. The chaos has emerged with various levels of complexities. With under-skilled employees, the future of the Engineers and Engineering Education looks bleak and ambiguous. Jack of all trades will have more employable possibilities than the Master of a particular skill. The faculty who teach the 21st Century Learner therefore must make a conscious, intentional choice to enhance his competencies to prepare students for the future. This study emphasizes the need to reawaken our educational policies and teaching-learning pedagogy. Certain learning strategies like flipped learning, project-based learning, problem-based learning will adapt the andragogic method. The teaching trends will be metamorphosed and establish good networking for inter/transdisciplinary research. Case studies and scenario building will churn in opportunities for the students to communicate, collaborate, critically think, and be creative. The empowered faculty will have his multi-skilled students placed well, the student will be industry ready and the industry will have the employee come along with his 21st Century skill set. The beneficiaries: the school, university, teacher now a facilitator, the student and the community at large will build not only a sustainable future but a thriving one too!}

In this paper, we present and discuss the results, in terms of complexity, of the introduction of a new scheduling system within the medical appointment and exam business processes of a large hospital. During the case study, we began by modelling the processes using the Business Process Modelling and Notation (BPMN) standard. We then used abstract metrics to compare the complexity between old (before the introduction of the scheduling system) and new processes, and interpreted the obtained results. Finally, we derived important conclusions that will help guide us in further business process optimization endeavors.}

An open-ended questionnaire and a semi-structured interview were used to glean the data. The results of MAXQDA analysis evinced that Chinese EFL learners had experienced a wide spectrum of positive and negative emotions in light of AI-based L2 education. Moreover, it was found that the participants took advantage of different antecedent-focused and response-focused strategies to regulate their AI-induced emotions.

Radiomics is a field of quantitative imaging involving the extraction of features from medical images transforming them into mineable data for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive purposes. In this work, we focused on the analysis of 2D brightfield images acquired with standard microscopes today available in all biological laboratories.
Methods
We analysed images of 3D multicellular spheroids, an in vitro model commonly used in Regenerative Medicine and Oncology. Besides describing Analysis of Spheroid version 3.0 (AnaSP 3.0), a new release of an open-source software suite specifically designed for segmenting and extracting features from 2D brightfield spheroid images. To validate the tool, spheroids generated with U-shape bottom multi-well plates and different concentrations of mesenchymal stem cells and osteosarcoma cell lines have been used.
Results
We demonstrated how advanced features included in AnaSP 3.0, i.e. sphericity, volume, and image gradient, may be used to indirectly assess the spheroidization of the spheroids over time, the number of cells composing the spheroids, and the extension of a possible central necrotic core.
Conclusions
AnaSP 3.0 is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/p/anasp. Compared to the previous versions, it includes a new algorithm for volume estimation and introduces new modules to extract advanced features using the original grey-level image values, rather than just relying on binary masks.}

This paper presented a multilingual cross-language processing of the documents with the abstractive and summarising of the documents. The proposed model is represented as the Hidden Markov Model LSTM Reinforcement Learning (HMMlstmRL). First, the developed model uses the Hidden Markov model for the computation of keywords in the cross-language words for the clustering. In the second stage, bi-directional long-short-term memory networks are used for key word extraction in the cross-language process. Finally, the proposed HMMlstmRL uses the voting concept in reinforcement learning for the identification and extraction of the keywords. The performance of the proposed HMMlstmRL is 2% better than that of the conventional bi-direction LSTM model.}

The bayesvl R package is an open program, designed for implementing Bayesian modeling and analysis using the Stan language’s no-U-turn (NUTS) sampler. The package combines the ability to construct Bayesian network models using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation technique, and the graphic capability of the ggplot2 package.

abstract = {Background
The World Health Organization anticipates a shortage of 14 million health workers by 2030, particularly affecting the Global South. Community health workers (CHWs) may mitigate the shortages of professional health care workers. Recent studies have explored the feasibility and effectiveness of shifting noncommunicable disease (NCD) services to CHWs. Challenges, such as high attrition rates and variable performance, persist due to inadequate organizational support and could hamper such efforts. Research on employee empowerment highlights how organizational structures affect employees’ perception of empowerment and retention.
Objective
This study aims to develop Scripted Medicine to empower CHWs to accept broader responsibilities in NCD care. It aims to convey relevant medical and counseling knowledge through medical algorithms and ThinkLets (ie, social scripts). Collaboration engineering research offers insights that could help address the structural issues in community-based health care and facilitate task shifting.
Methods
This study followed a design science research approach to implement a mobile health–supported, community-based intervention in 2 districts of Lesotho. We first developed the medical algorithms and ThinkLets based on insights from collaboration engineering and algorithmic management literature. We then evaluated the designed approach in a field study in the ComBaCaL (Community Based Chronic Disease Care Lesotho) project. The field study included 10 newly recruited CHWs and spanned over 2 weeks of training and 12 weeks of field experience. Following an abductive approach, we analyzed surveys, interviews, and observations to study how Scripted Medicine empowers CHWs to accept broader responsibilities in NCD care.
Results
Scripted Medicine successfully conveyed the required medical and counseling knowledge through medical algorithms and ThinkLets. We found that medical algorithms predominantly influenced CHWs’ perception of structural empowerment, while ThinkLets affected their psychological empowerment. The different perceptions between the groups of CHWs from the 2 districts highlighted the importance of considering the cultural and economic context.
Conclusions
We propose Scripted Medicine as a novel approach to CHW empowerment inspired by collaboration engineering and algorithmic management. Scripted Medicine broadens the perspective on mobile health–supported, community-based health care. It emphasizes the need to script not only essential medical knowledge but also script counseling expertise. These scripts allow CHWs to embed medical knowledge into the social interactions in community-based health care. Scripted Medicine empowers CHW to accept broader responsibilities to address the imminent shortage of medical professionals in the Global South.}

Client stories (either real or a composite based on many clients) are often used in ICBT to facilitate learning. However, these stories remain understudied in terms of how they are perceived by clients, as well as their relationship to ICBT engagement, satisfaction, and outcomes. Among a sample of 324 clients enrolled in transdiagnostic ICBT targeting symptoms of depression and anxiety, we examined client perceptions of stories through mixed-method qualitative (open-ended) and quantitative (closed-ended) data collection. Specifically, 234 (72.22 %) clients responded to questions about stories at 4 weeks and 221 (68.21 %) responded to questions at 8 weeks. Most clients who responded to questions endorsed reviewing at least some stories (79.06 % at 4 weeks, 71.95 % at 8 weeks). Moreover, they rated stories positively in terms of being relatable, making clients feel less alone, increasing knowledge, providing ideas for how to use skills, and motivating clients to use skills. These perceptions of stories remained stable over the course of treatment. Stories were perceived more positively among those with lower symptom severity at 8 weeks as well as those who were more satisfied with ICBT at 8 weeks. Story perceptions at 4 weeks were predictive of decreased post-treatment anxiety symptom severity but not depression while controlling for baseline scores, age, and education. 26.49 % of clients at 4 weeks who reviewed stories and 33.33 % at 8 weeks provided suggestions about how to improve stories. In a qualitative analysis, we found 5 categories of suggestions including increasing the variety of issues and relatability of stories, ensuring the stories are realistic, refining the formatting, and making the stories shorter. Overall, this study provides insights into how client stories could be improved to play a more significant role in future ICBT programs.}

While previous research on sentiment analysis has shifted from analyzing single data types to incorporating multimodal data, current studies face certain limitations. These include overlooking the impact of redundant information within feature sequences of each modality, failing to account for the complementarity between modality data, and neglecting the varying significance of different modalities in conveying sentiments. This paper introduces a sentiment analysis framework designed for text information enhancement and multimodal feature fusion. The text modality is central to this framework, around which an attention mechanism augments emotional correlations between modalities. An expanded sentiment lexicon refines the representation of multimodal features, thus capturing emotional information more accurately. Experimental evaluations conducted on two standard datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, show that the accuracy of the proposed method in multimodal emotion recognition tasks reaches 85.7% and 85.8% respectively, at 1.6% and 1.8% higher than the baseline methods. Thus, it demonstrates robust regression and classification performance.}

However, there is a dearth of research that examined how decision-making involving various moral foundations in video games can influence players' intergroup perceptions. Therefore, this study examined how players’ in-game decisions with respect to the six moral foundations and interactions with different non-player characters’ (NPCs’) identities influenced their attitudes toward outgroup foreign immigrants. A 2 (video game scenarios: moral choices vs. non-moral choices) by 3 (NPCs’ nationality: all citizens vs. citizens and foreigners vs. all foreigners) experiment was conducted (N = 300). There was no main interaction effect across conditions. Participants who interacted with only citizen NPCs reported significantly more positive post-game attitudes toward immigrants than those who interacted with both citizen and foreigner characters. Participants who violated the care/harm, ingroup/loyalty, and liberty/oppression foundations experienced higher levels of guilt, but this had no impact on their immigrant attitudes. However, those who violated the fairness/reciprocity and liberty/oppression foundations reported poorer intergroup attitudes. Implications of the findings are discussed.}

abstract = {Concept-based sentiment analysis (CBSA) methods have gained prominence in natural language processing in recent years. These methods consider the underlying semantic meanings of text to perform different tasks such as Twitter sentiment analysis (assigning positive, negative, or neutral sentiment to Tweets). CBSA is superior to traditional statistical methods for accurately discovering sentiment labels. Due to a limited knowledge base, these methods are unable to identify the sentiment polarity of all kinds of text. Therefore, supervised learning techniques are mostly ensembled with CBSA methods to classify the whole text. These techniques require labeled data. It is a tedious and time-consuming task due to the manually labeling of large datasets (Such as Twitter datasets). Therefore, an unsupervised learning mechanism can be a better alternative to solve this problem. In this paper, a novel unsupervised learning framework based on Concept-based and hierarchical clustering is proposed for Twitter sentiment analysis. Popular hierarchical clustering methods including single linkage, complete linkage, and average linkage algorithms are ensembled serially. Two different feature representation methods including Boolean and Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) are investigated. We have also experimented with Well-known classifiers (Naive Bayes, Neural Network) for a fair comparison. Accuracy measure (proportion of correct predictions) is used to evaluate the performance of understudied techniques. It is empirically shown that the performance of unsupervised learning techniques is comparable with supervised learning techniques.}

In order to enhance its performance, we propose in this paper a population-distributed model using particle swarm optimization algorithm and island model structure. We investigate the effect of migration parameters such as the topology migration and the migration strategies. The empirical results using set of test functions show that the proposed PSO model is better to achieve an appropriate tradeoff between intensification and diversification.}

abstract = {There are thirty-four provincial administrative regions in China, and each region possesses its own distinct food culture. However, existing studies on flavor-based research often treat Chinese dishes from various regions as a single entity, resulting in biases when examining regional distinctions and the variety of recipes. To explore the potential correlation between food ingredients and regions, this paper performs flavor analysis and region prediction for Chinese typical dishes. A new dataset including 1534 recipes combined with a compound-ingredient list to construct a compound-ingredient-recipe network. The results indicate that in terms of food ingredient selection, Hainan shows the highest degree of flavor compound sharing, while Shanghai does the lowest. While all the regions studied tend to exhibit negative food pairing according to the food pairing hypothesis, a region with a high degree of flavor sharing is more able to become prominent representation of the corresponding flavor branch through the analysis of representative ingredients. Across the 14 regions studied, the frequency of ingredient usage within a region plays a crucial role in maintaining its distinct flavor profile. Concerning the individual contributions of ingredients to flavor compound sharing, the positive contributions are linked to rice and natural spices, including Welsh onion, ginger, and garlic, while the negative contributions are primarily associated with flour, pork, and traditional Chinese condiments such as soy sauce, cooking wine, and grain vinegar. Multiple deep learning experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of combining ingredient and flavor information to region prediction for recipes.}

The structural information of sign language motion units plays a crucial role in semantic representation. However, most existing CSLR methods treat motion units as a whole appearance in the video sequence, neglecting the exploitation and explanation of structural information in the models. This paper proposes a Structure-Aware Graph Convolutional Neural Network (SA-GNN) model for CSLR. This model constructs a spatial–temporal scene graph, explicitly capturing motion units’ spatial structure and temporal variation. Furthermore, to effectively train the SA-GNN, we propose an adaptive bootstrap strategy that enhances weak supervision using dense pseudo labels. This strategy incorporates a confidence cross-entropy loss to adjust the distribution of pseudo labels adaptively. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive results on popular CSLR datasets.}

Previous efforts have made strides in identifying and reducing toxicity; however, a unified and adaptable framework for managing toxic content across diverse online discourse remains essential. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework RESPECT designed to effectively identify and mitigate toxicity in online conversations. The framework comprises two components: an encoder-only model for detecting toxicity and a decoder-only model for generating debiased versions of the text. By leveraging the capabilities of transformer-based models, toxicity is addressed as a binary classification problem. Subsequently, open-source and proprietary large language models are utilized through prompt-based approaches to rewrite toxic text into non-toxic, and making sure these are contextually accurate alternatives. Empirical results demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces toxicity across various conversational styles, fostering safer and more respectful communication in online environments.}

Yet, we consider that this accelerated pace of propagation of online education has left behind an important aspect needed for the act of teaching, namely studying and understanding student archetypes. By this we mean the common patterns which define the interaction type, dedication amount, and finalization perspective of courses. This paper introduces an original set of student profiles specific to online courses, and it does so by means of data mining and supervised learning. We use the responses from an online questionnaire to gather detailed opinion from 632 students from Romania regarding the advantages and disadvantages of MOOCs, as well as the reasons for not joining online courses. Based on the extracted statistics, we present six decision trees for classifying the finalization and participation rates of online courses based on the students individual traits.

The program provided a sample of students between the ages of 15 to 18 a laptop and their household’s free access to unlimited broadband internet for up to two years.

abstract = {Understanding how people use technology remains important, particularly when measuring the impact this might have on individuals and society. To date, research within psychological science often frames new technology as problematic with overwhelmingly negative consequences. However, this paper argues that the latest generation of psychometric tools, which aim to assess smartphone usage, are unable to capture technology related experiences or behaviors. As a result, many conclusions concerning the psychological impact of technology use remain unsound. Current assessments have also failed to keep pace with new methodological developments and these data-intensive approaches challenge the notion that smartphones and related technologies are inherently problematic. The field should now consider how it might re-position itself conceptually and methodologically given that many ‘addictive’ technologies have long since become intertwined with daily life.}

The analysis demonstrates potential insights to be gained by this approach, revealing clear patterns in the structure of travel to work flows between geodemographic clusters. Our broad approach is not limited to use in specific countries and has potential application for use with data from non-census sources.}

abstract = {Healthcare has undergone significant changes in recent decades to incorporate new technology and meet evolving needs of the people and the community. This shift has replaced traditional methods like prescription pads and patient charts with digital screens and software. The adoption of these advancements has had a positive impact on patient outcomes and the number of lives saved. It has been recognized that healthcare, including nursing, is experiencing transformative changes due to the presence of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics systems. These digital technologies have a profound global influence on nursing, emphasizing the importance for nurses to excel both clinically and technologically. Virtual reality (VR) is a form of simulation that utilizes advanced equipment and augmented reality (AR) interventions. VR simulations offer nursing students a valuable opportunity to practice high-risk interventions on virtual patients, allowing them to gain experience without posing any risk to patient safety. AR holds significant promise in the field of education, particularly in medical and nursing education. This is due to its unique capability to seamlessly blend virtual objects with the real world, enhancing simulations and creating a more realistic and immersive learning experience. By integrating virtual elements into the physical reality of users, AR has the potential to revolutionize medical and nursing education by providing students with hands-on interactive training opportunities that closely resemble real-life scenarios. This technology can enhance the understanding and retention of complex medical and nursing concepts, improve diagnostic skills, and facilitate practical learning in a safe and controlled environment. The integration of AR in medical and nursing education has the potential to greatly benefit students and ultimately contribute to the advancement of healthcare. Computer-assisted procedures and surgeries have taken its place in healthcare industry. With the increasing prevalence of robotic surgery, surgeons are faced with the challenge of enhancing and maintaining their skills while ensuring patient safety. Robotic surgery offers several advantages, including faster recovery times, lower complication rates, reduced blood loss, and the restoration of site-specific functions. In addition, telehealth and health informatics have been well accepted in the healthcare industry which assist in delivering various healthcare services remotely. Telehealth includes remote patient monitoring, interventions, education, patient follow-ups, data collection, pain management, and innovative care approaches. One emerging role for nurses in telehealth is telephone triage, which utilizes electronic information and communication technologies to provide healthcare support when distance separates the participants. Through telehealth, nurses excel in providing long-term wellness, self-management, and remote healthcare for their patients which involves offering consultations and treatments using digital platforms. Health informatics refers to the application of the information technologies in the healthcare field to enhance healthcare and overall health of the population. With advancements in technology, the collection, analysis, and utilization of healthcare data have become more effective. In nursing practice, informatics has had a significant impact on documentation. Traditional methods such as paper charts and handwritten notes have been replaced by easily accessible electronic health records and other systems that store and update patients’ medical history. Through electronic charting, nurses can access information and utilize it to improve patient care. Additionally, these medical records can be accessed by all medical professionals involved in the patient’s care, both internally and externally. Health informatics also assists nurses in providing the best possible care by tracking staff shortages, workflow, and facilitating communication within the team to enhance processes without experiencing burnout. Determining the most effective evidence-based practices also involves the use of health informatics, as analyzing collected data on patient care and outcomes helps determine the best care for future patients. Evolution of digital health impacts the future of our healthcare industry.}

These types of teams require different composition of team members using their profile scores in order to achieve their respective aims. Innovative teams deal with the whole organizations as a one unit and may question all underlying assumption; knowledge teams span multiple functions; quality teams addressed issues in a silo function. A prototype is developed to construct teams from an actual data base of employee profiles in a developing nation. A user may request one of the three types of teams, state duration in time, and displays the selected members with their respective profile scores of the four quadrants. The teams formed maybe used in software development teams as well as business plan teams. These team constructs should foster and nurture innovative idea generation and maintain the competitive advantage of global organizations.}

Based on data collected from 158 Chinese software engineers, we found that organizational commitment positively affects individuals’ willingness to report, while interpersonal closeness with the wrongdoer negatively affects willingness to report. With respect to the influence of Confucian ethics, our findings suggest that: (1) individuals’ ethical disposition toward loyalty between sovereign and subject (interpreted in this research as loyalty to one's organization) strengthens the positive effect of organizational commitment on willingness to report, and (2) individuals’ ethical disposition on trust between friends strengthens the negative effect of interpersonal closeness with the wrongdoer on willingness to report.}

abstract = {Background
Chatbots enable users to have humanlike conversations on various topics and can vary widely in complexity and functionality. An area of research priority in chatbots is democratizing chatbots to all, removing barriers to entry, such as financial ones, to help make chatbots a possibility for the wider global population to improve access to information, help reduce the digital divide between nations, and improve areas of public good (eg, health communication). Chatbots in this space may help create the potential for improved health outcomes, potentially alleviating some of the burdens on health care providers and systems to be the sole voices of outreach to public health.
Objective
This study explored the feasibility of developing a chatbot using approaches that are accessible in low- and middle-resource settings, such as using technology that is low cost, can be developed by nonprogrammers, and can be deployed over social media platforms to reach the broadest-possible audience without the need for a specialized technical team.
Methods
This study is presented in 2 parts. First, we detailed the design and development of a chatbot, VWise, including the resources used and development considerations for the conversational model. Next, we conducted a case study of 33 participants who engaged in a pilot with our chatbot. We explored the following 3 research questions: (1) Is it feasible to develop and implement a chatbot addressing a public health issue with only minimal resources? (2) What is the participants’ experience with using the chatbot? (3) What kinds of measures of engagement are observed from using the chatbot?
Results
A high level of engagement with the chatbot was demonstrated by the large number of participants who stayed with the conversation to its natural end (n=17, 52%), requested to see the free online resource, selected to view all information about a given concern, and returned to have a dialogue about a second concern (n=12, 36%).
Conclusions
This study explored the feasibility of and the design and development considerations for a chatbot, VWise. Our early findings from this initial pilot suggest that developing a functioning and low-cost chatbot is feasible, even in low-resource environments. Our results show that low-resource environments can enter the health communication chatbot space using readily available human and technical resources. However, despite these early indicators, many limitations exist in this study and further work with a larger sample size and greater diversity of participants is needed. This study represents early work on a chatbot in its virtual infancy. We hope this study will help provide those who feel chatbot access may be out of reach with a useful guide to enter this space, enabling more democratized access to chatbots for all.}

abstract = {Background
To facilitate decision-making capacity between options of care under real-life service conditions, clinical trials must be pragmatic to evaluate mobile health (mHealth) interventions under the variable conditions of health care settings with a wide range of participants. The mHealth interventions require changes in the behavior of patients and providers, creating considerable complexity and ambiguity related to causal chains. Process evaluations of the implementation are necessary to shed light on the range of unanticipated effects an intervention may have, what the active ingredients in everyday practice are, how they exert their effect, and how these may vary among recipients or between sites.
Objective
Building on the CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile HEalth Applications and onLine TeleHealth) statement and participatory evaluation theory, we present a framework for the process evaluations for mHealth interventions in multiple cultural settings. We also describe the application of this evaluation framework to the implementation of DREAM-GLOBAL (Diagnosing hypertension—Engaging Action and Management in Getting Lower BP in Indigenous and LMIC [low- and middle-income countries]), a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT), and mHealth intervention designed to improve hypertension management in low-resource environments. We describe the evaluation questions and the data collection processes developed by us.
Methods
Our literature review revealed that there is a significant knowledge gap related to the development of a process evaluation framework for mHealth interventions. We used community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods and formative research data to develop a process evaluation framework nested within a pragmatic RCT.
Results
Four human organizational levels of participants impacted by the mHealth intervention were identified that included patients, providers, community and organizations actors, and health systems and settings. These four levels represent evaluation domains and became the core focus of the evaluation. In addition, primary implementation themes to explore in each of the domains were identified as follows: (1) the major active components of the intervention, (2) technology of the intervention, (3) cultural congruence, (4) task shifting, and (5) unintended consequences. Using the four organizational domains and their interaction with primary implementation themes, we developed detailed evaluation research questions and identified the data or information sources to best answer our questions.
Conclusions
Using DREAM-GLOBAL to illustrate our approach, we succeeded in developing an uncomplicated process evaluation framework for mHealth interventions that provide key information to stakeholders, which can optimize implementation of a pragmatic trial as well as inform scale up. The human organizational level domains used to focus the primary implementation themes in the DREAM-GLOBAL process evaluation framework are sufficiently supported in our research, and the literature and can serve as a valuable tool for other mHealth process evaluations.

abstract = {We examined how playing a game employing augmented reality (AR) technology increases attachment to the place of playing. Place attachment refers to the relationship between people and places, which has numerous benefits for individual well-being. Popular location-based AR games often include elements that are known to predict place attachment: exploration, social relations or the experience of enjoyment in a place. We argue that positive emotions triggered by playing can influence players’ place attachment via the process of gamification. We tested this hypothesis in a correlational study conducted among Pokémon Go players. Our analyses showed that satisfaction from playing and the social relations made during play positively predict place attachment, but the amount of time spent on playing does not. A series of mediation analyses showed that relations among game satisfaction, social relations, and place attachment were mediated by the appraisal of the place as exciting. This study demonstrated a mechanism of emotional transfer between positive experiences from playing and place attachment, which may prove useful in other domains, such as education, land conservation, or marketing.}

abstract = {Background
Reductions in opioid prescribing by health care providers can lead to a decreased risk of opioid dependence in patients. Peer comparison has been demonstrated to impact providers’ prescribing habits, though its effect on opioid prescribing has predominantly been studied in the emergency department setting.
Objective
The purpose of this study is to describe the development of an enterprise-wide opioid scorecard, the architecture of its implementation, and plans for future research on its effects.
Methods
Using data generated by the author’s enterprise vendor–based electronic health record, the enterprise analytics software, and expertise from a dedicated group of informaticists, physicians, and analysts, the authors developed an opioid scorecard that was released on a quarterly basis via email to all opioid prescribers at our institution. These scorecards compare providers’ opioid prescribing habits on the basis of established metrics to those of their peers within their specialty throughout the enterprise.
Results
At the time of this study’s completion, 2034 providers have received at least 1 scorecard over a 5-quarter period ending in September 2021. Poisson regression demonstrated a 1.6% quarterly reduction in opioid prescribing, and chi-square analysis demonstrated pre-post reductions in the proportion of prescriptions longer than 5 days’ duration and a morphine equivalent daily dose of >50.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first peer comparison effort with high-quality evidence-based metrics of this scale published in the literature. By sharing this process for designing the metrics and the process of distribution, the authors hope to influence other health systems to attempt to curb the opioid pandemic through peer comparison. Future research examining the effects of this intervention could demonstrate significant reductions in opioid prescribing, thus potentially reducing the progression of individual patients to opioid use disorder and the associated increased risk of morbidity and mortality.}

We examined whether characteristics of communication media that facilitate intergroup encounters shape its effect on out-group attitudes. Specifically, we propose that concealing individuating cues about out-group members during CMIC increases prejudice, as interaction partners are perceived as less socially present. To assess these hypotheses, we conducted two mixed-factorial experiments. Participants engaged in synchronous text-chat with out-group members (Study 1) and a confederate (Study 2) who either shared or concealed their name and photo. Overall, CMIC reduced negative out-group sentiments. Study 2 showed, however, that out-group members' anonymity decreased perceived social presence, which was associated with less positive evaluations of the CMIC and higher prejudice. In conclusion, CMIC can contribute to conflict resolution interventions, preparing individuals for direct intergroup contact, if its affordances or conversation topics enhance interaction partners' social presence.}

Due to this, a categorical regression model was performed to test the hypotheses. The results showed that the industry analysis is more relevant for those companies that adopt a mature market strategy. The analysis of consumer buying behavior and the analysis of market demand dynamics prevail in the new markets strategy. Although product differentiation to achieve positioning is an important driver for companies that use growth market strategies, it is concluded that the consumer buying behavior hypothesis is valid because the analysis allows implementing differentiation actions that are included in strategic control, which is a complex thought process developed by top management.}

abstract = {Background
Parents use apps to access information on child health, but there are no standards for providing evidence-based advice, support, and information. Well-developed apps that promote appropriate infant feeding and play can support healthy growth and development. A 2015 systematic assessment of smartphone apps in Australia about infant feeding and play found that most apps had minimal information, with poor readability and app quality.
Objective
This study aimed to systematically evaluate the information and quality of smartphone apps providing information on breastfeeding, formula feeding, introducing solids, or infant play for consumers.
Methods
The Google Play store and Apple App Store were searched for free and paid Android and iPhone Operating System (iOS) apps using keywords for infant feeding, breastfeeding, formula feeding, and tummy time. The apps were evaluated between September 2018 and January 2019 for information content based on Australian guidelines, app quality using the 5-point Mobile App Rating Scale, readability, and suitability of health information.
Results
A total of 2196 unique apps were found and screened. Overall, 47 apps were evaluated, totaling 59 evaluations for apps across both the Android and iOS platforms. In all, 11 apps had affiliations to universities and health services as app developers, writers, or editors. Furthermore, 33 apps were commercially developed. The information contained within the apps was poor: 64% (38/59) of the evaluations found no or low coverage of information found in the Australian guidelines on infant feeding and activity, and 53% (31/59) of the evaluations found incomplete or incorrect information with regard to the depth of information provided. Subjective app assessment by health care practitioners on whether they would use, purchase, or recommend the app ranged from poor to acceptable (median 2.50). Objective assessment of the apps’ engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information was scored as acceptable (median 3.63). The median readability score for the apps was at the American Grade 8 reading level. The suitability of health information was rated superior or adequate for content, reading demand, layout, and interaction with the readers.
Conclusions
The quality of smartphone apps on infant feeding and activity was moderate based on the objective measurements of engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information from a reliable source. The overall quality of information on infant feeding and activity was poor, indicated by low coverage of topics and incomplete or partially complete information. The key areas for improvement involved providing evidence-based information consistent with the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council’s Infant Feeding Guidelines. Apps supported and developed by health care professionals with adequate health service funding can ensure that parents are provided with credible and reliable resources.}

While the use of formal brokers has increased, particularly in globally distributed work, the extant literature has so far paid little attention to the information brokering challenges they face. Our case analysis revealed that, despite the structured setting, information users often bypass brokers and exchange information directly, also known as a workaround, thus disrupting the brokering process. In this scenario, the broker is displaced and is not able to broker. Our findings suggest that formal brokers do not necessarily reassume their brokering role once workarounds are detected. Instead, they first assess the conditions that led to the workarounds and the impact (positive or negative) on the information exchange network. Should the impact be negative, formal brokers regain their brokering role by deploying protective actions. However, a positive impact on the information exchange network allow brokers to maintain a nonbrokering position, thus passively allowing connecting actions to resume. We describe three practices that formal brokers pursue when workarounds are present and conclude by outlining the contributions to research and practice.}

Korean-Chinese (KC) women make up the largest group of female migrants in South Korea. To prevent and manage chronic diseases in middle-aged KC women working full time, it is necessary to develop health promotion programs that utilize an online platform because such a platform would allow individuals to participate in health promotion interventions at their convenience.
Objective
This study aimed to develop a living lab for a mobile-based health (LLm Health) program focused on improving the physical activity and cultural adaptation of KC women workers.
Methods
We used a mixed methods design. Living lab principles were factored into the LLm Health program, including the use of multiple methods, user engagement, multistakeholder participants, real-life settings, and cocreation. The program was developed using the 4 steps of the intervention mapping method: needs assessment, setting of objectives, identification of intervention strategies, and intervention design. Needs assessment was conducted through a literature review, focus group interviews with a total of 16 middle-aged KC women, and an online survey related to health promotion of migrant workers given to 38 stakeholders. KC middle-aged women participated in the early stages of program development and provided the idea of developing programs and mobile apps to enhance physical activity and acculturation. The mobile app developed in the program was validated with the help of 12 KC women and 4 experts, including 3 nursing professors and a professor of physical education. They were asked to rate each item based on content, interface design, and technology on a 4-point scale using a 23-item Smartphone App Evaluation Tool for Health Care.
Results
The LLm Health program comprised a 24-week walking program using Fitbit devices, the mobile app, and social cognitive interventions. The mobile app contained 6 components: a step counter, an exercise timer, an online chat function, health information, level of cardiovascular risk, and health status. The cultural aspects and lifestyles of KC women were accommodated in the entire process of program development. The content validity of the mobile app was found to be 0.90 and 0.96 according to the 12 KC women and 4 experts, respectively.
Conclusions
The mobile app was found to be valid and acceptable for KC women. The living lab approach was a useful strategy for developing a culturally adaptive LLm Health program for KC women workers, leading to their active participation in the overall research process, including needs assessment, program composition, and pre-evaluation.}

This study delves into the examination of how vendor's in-role and extra-role performance jointly impact CCBs. Employing polynomial regression and response surface analysis, this research scrutinizes the impacts of the congruence and incongruence between the vendor's in-role and extra-role performance as well as the boundary condition of environmental dynamism. The findings indicate that the CCBs are higher when in-role performance matches extra-role performance at a high level. Furthermore, when employees' in-role and extra-role performance are incongruent, CCBs decrease as the discrepancy increases. Environmental dynamism moderates these relationships.}

There are several variables studied in testing the model including facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, and usefulness of students. Analysis of the model is carried out by surveying users, namely students, who have interacted with the concept of e-learning. In the study, quantitative questionnaires were distributed to 469 students in Bandung (Indonesia), with experience using e-learning as an online learning method. The research model was tested through the SEM (Structural Equation Model) approach with the SmartPLS tool, while the test was carried out twice with the PLS Algorithm and Bootstrapping process. Furthermore, the evaluation of the model through the Inner and Outer tests and research hypothesis testing. The test results stated that the self-efficacy of students has a positive relationship with the perceived usefulness of students, and indirectly self-efficacy is also able to increase the continuance intention of students on the concept of e-learning on campus. Perceived usefulness from students is able to mediate between self-efficacy and increase student continuance intention. Another finding from the research is that the facilitation conditions of e-learning owned by students are not able to change the perceived usefulness and continuance intention. The novelty of the research explains that there is a new model, namely the technology adoption model on the e-learning concept, which will run well if it is supported by the self-efficacy of the user and the mediation of perceived usefulness. This research is important to pay attention to, especially for universities that implement the concept of e-learning, which need to pay attention to the readiness of students related to self-efficacy and perceived usefulness.}

Over and above, worker diversification culminates in the novel ideology of Industry 5.0; where a triad is established between sustainability, human-centricity, and resilience within manufacturing. This broadens the horizon for worker diversification, especially for people with disabilities who may be estranged from the manufacturing shop floor due to an absence of accessibility, stigma, and other lingering challenges. In pursuit of comprehending these hurdles in the form of themes, a set of interviews were conducted with designers and engineers from a range of manufacturing companies, followed by a Reflexive Thematic Analysis Exercise. Three umbrella themes and eight sub-themes revealed an apparent level of friction between manufacturing engineers and the potential of recruiting operators with disabilities, a lack of design knowledge in creating inclusive workstations, and an absence of social sustainability with respect to disability employment in manufacturing. Accordingly, two major areas for future work by engineers, designers and academics are also proposed.}

IDN homograph takes advantage of some characters in different native languages in internationalized domain names that look similar to legitimate ones. Although researchers have proposed several enlightening detection methods, most of them focused on detecting typosquatting domain names. The ones focused on IDN homograph attack detection either need to enhance the generalization ability or improve detection performance caused by data imbalance. In this paper, we devised a Generative Adversarial Network with a Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) algorithm to solve the data imbalance problem. We transform domain names into images and calculate their similarity by Siamese neural networks. Our work can identify whether a domain name is IDN homograph or not effectively. We use the dataset generated based on Unicode tables, publicly available homograph tools, and the Internet traffic captured from the China Education Research Network backbone (CERNET) to evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy and reduces the false positive rate in detecting homograph domain names. In addition, it can also accurately identify typosquatting in phishing pages.}

However, thus far, such impact has been mainly framed in terms of human choice manipulation and privacy infringements, while the ethical issue of human freedom of choice in predictive MLAs has been poorly explored per se. This chapter aims to fill this gap and provide a systematic ethical inquiry into the impact raised by predictive MLAs on the preconditions underlying the exercise of freedom of choice, online and beyond. To this aim, we first pursue an ethical inquiry into the preconditions securing at a minimum threshold human freedom of choice, drawing insights on main theories developed both in moral philosophy and in sociopolitical philosophy. Then, we analyze how MLAs are governing and reshaping the contexts in which we both prepare and make our choices. We show how by doing so MLAs negatively affect the preconditions of our freedom of choice and the risks such impact raises in the short and long term, at the individual and collective level. Finally, we address such risks and highlight how our ethical inquiry helps pinpointing some key ethical criteria that ought to be considered and operationalized to secure our freedom of choice as a fundamental ethical-normative value in our contemporary MLA-driven societies.}

Previous research has suggested that PIU is associated with higher rates of mental health disorders, psychological distress, and some substance misuse behaviors in college students. This study utilizes data from 417,780 US college students to explore associations between PIU and a variety of substance use outcomes. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were used to investigate associations between PIU and substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis, misuse of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine/methamphetamine, sedatives, hallucinogens, opiates, inhalants, MDMA, other club drugs, prescription pain killers, prescription sedatives, and prescription stimulants. Among the 417,780 US college students included in our analytic cohort, 123,330 (29.52%) reported PIU. Students who demonstrated PIU had a significantly higher risk of substance misuse behaviors, including misuse of opiate, sedative, hallucinogen, club drugs, and inhalant, illicit use of prescription pain killers, and SUD diagnosis, than their peers who did not demonstrate patterns of PIU. These findings highlight the need to promote the physical, social, and emotional wellbeing of students more effectively by considering PIU in prevention and intervention efforts aimed to decrease the prevalence of addictive behaviors in US college settings.}

The Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) was developed to rigorously perform these measurements with the support of the Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD). In this paper, a Word Embedding-based Moral Foundation Assignment (WEMFA) approach has been designed, implemented, and applied to the movie domain for multiple assignment of moral foundations. WEMFA may use any dictionary, and it has been applied to a movie collection generated from movie synopses. A comparison between WEMFA and MoralStrength, the only approach found in the scientific literature, has been carried out. The proposed approach provided a percentage improvement of 41.7% with respect to the best version of MoralStrength, which uses an extension of the original MFD almost 10 times larger in number of terms. In addition, an extension of the original MFD (MFD24) has been built by adding 14 new moral foundations to the 10 original ones, enriching the moral context. WEMFA provided a mean accuracy of 78% with MFD24 despite the increment of the number of moral foundations. Besides, new extended dictionaries or even totally different ones can be used with WEMFA, since it does not need any training.}

abstract = {Background
User-centered design processes are infrequently employed and not fully explored for building mobile health (mHealth) apps that are particularly targeted to health professionals as end users. The authors have used a user-centered design–based approach to build an mHealth app for health professionals, tasked to deliver medical laboratory-related information on a daily basis.
Objective
Our objective is to generate a simple and functional user-centered design process for mHealth apps for health professionals. This paper presents the key learnings from design activities.
Methods
A stratified random sample of doctors and nurses was recruited for the study. The design activities were planned in the following sequence: focus group discussion for situation analysis and information architecture, design activity 1 for wireframe designing, design activity 2 for wireframe testing, and user testing sessions 1 and 2.
Results
The final design and functions of the app, information architecture, and interactive elements were largely influenced by the participatory design–based user-centered design activities. As a result of the design process, we could identify the mental models of processing requests for information and personal preferences based on the experience. These findings were directly or indirectly incorporated into the app design. Furthermore, finding alternative ways of working within time constraints and cultural barriers and the methods employed to manage the challenges of interdisciplinary discourse stood out among the lessons learned.
Conclusions
We recommend a user-centered design process based on a participatory design approach in mHealth app design, enriched with focus group discussions where possible.}

As a quantitative data collection tool, the 21st century skills scale was utilized [47]. In addition to quantitative data, qualitative data were collected from the teachers and students through semi-structured interviews. Within the scope of the research, students participated in robotic design courses with Arduino over the learning management system for ten weeks and participated in a competition with their products at the end of the activity. The activity was held with the participation of 62 students and 10 teachers. The findings of the study showed that educational robotic activities caused a significant increase in the affective domain of the students. While it did not cause any significant increase in the cognitive and sociocultural domains, the average scores of students increased on post-tests compared to the pretests for these two domains. In addition, students’ 21st century skills did not differ according to gender. Although there is no statistically significant difference in pretest–posttest results due to grade level, an increase was observed in posttest averages at each grade level. The observed increase in the post-tests, although not statistical, reveals the positive effect of educational robotic coding in terms of students’ 21st century skills. To support the results of the quantitative data, the analysis of the qualitative data revealed a consensus of both teachers and students on the contribution of such applications to the advancement of contemporary skills. In conclusion, the results of this study show that educational robotic coding can be used to develop 21st century skills of elementary school students.}

We use ChatGPT3.5 to automatically structure and expand medication statements in discharge summaries and thus make them easier to interpret for people and machines. Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Text Expansion (EX) are used with different prompt strategies in a zero- and few-shot setting. 100 medication statements were manually annotated and curated. NER performance was measured by using strict and partial matching. For the EX task, two experts interpreted the results by assessing semantic equivalence between original and expanded statements. The model performance was measured by precision, recall, and F1 score. For NER, the best-performing prompt reached an average F1 score of 0.94 in the test set. For EX, the few-shot prompt showed superior performance among other prompts, with an average F1 score of 0.87. Our study demonstrates good performance for NER and EX tasks in free-text medication statements using ChatGPT3.5. Compared to a zero-shot baseline, a few-shot approach prevented the system from hallucinating, which is essential when processing safety-relevant medication data. We tested ChatGPT3.5-tuned prompts on other LLMs, including ChatGPT4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, MedLM-1.5-Large, and DeepSeekV3. The findings showed most models outperformed ChatGPT3.5 in NER and EX tasks.}

abstract = {Social networking platforms give users countless opportunities to share information, collaborate, and communicate positively. The same platform can be extended to a fabricated and poisonous atmosphere that gives an impersonal, harmful platform for online misuse and assault. Cyberstalking is when someone uses an internet system to ridicule, torment, insult, criticize, slander, and discredit a victim while never seeing them. With the growth of social networks, Facebook has become the online arena for bullying. Since the effects could result in a widespread contagion, it is vital to have models and mechanisms in place for the automatic identification and removal of internet cyberbullying data. This paper presents a robust hybrid ML model for cyberbullying detection in the Bengali language on social media. The Bengalibullying proposal involves an effective text preprocessing to make the Bengali text data into a useful text format, feature extraction using the TfidfVectorizer (TFID) to get the beneficial information of text data and resampling by Instance Hardness Threshold (IHT) procedure to balance the dataset to avoid overfitting or underfitting problems. In our experiment, we used the publicly available Bangla text dataset (44,001 comments) and got the highest performance ever published works on it. The model achieved the most elevated accuracy rate of 98.57% and 98.82% in binary and multilabel classification to detect cyberbullying on social media in the Bengali language. Our best performance findings are more effective than any previous effort in identifying and categorizing bullying in the Bengali language. As a result, we might use our model to correctly classify Bengali bullying in online bullying detection systems, protecting people from being the targets of social bullying.}

The goal of this paper is to identify patterns in the development of banking products in the modern economy, which is characterized by the instability of the regulatory environment, a significant number of technological innovations in related areas, conflicting demographic trends, and an accelerated change in customer preferences. Data makes it possible to form a rather wide database of balanced panel data covering most regions of Russia over a long period (from 2010 to 2020). The results obtained indicate a fairly high quality of the regression: characteristics such as income and credit history strongly affect the volume of loans in a region (these results were expected as mentioned factors in most cases indicate a normal inertial process of changing the attitude of credit institutions and their customers to a banking product, in this case – retail lending). On the other hand, the factors characterizing the non-financial socio-demographic characteristics of the population of the regions, such as quality of health care, financial literacy, also turned out to be significant. The obtained quantitative estimates might be used for credit institutions for management of risks and product development in various territories and planning expansion.}

Since SI encompasses a multitude of the dimensions as its construct, a suitable and effective multi-criteria decision framework is proposed to measure SI. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been established as a robust multi-criteria decision-making tool and thus, will be apt for generating SI index which is termed as spiritual quotient (SQ) by considering the SI construct.

Future BCI will probably has to be empowered by AI capable of anticipating, channeling, nudging, and effectively encouraging (as well as discouraging) some kinds of thoughts and choices, much like it completes queries and fulfills prompts. Unless brains are tightly geared with AI, human awareness will get left behind to be merely “on the loop” instead of “in the loop.” Hence, BCI neurotechnology could not be used in a “neutral manner” by generic consumers apart from their social surroundings and cultural traditions. Its increasing usage will generate considerable reconfiguration and disruption of extant social, economic, and power balances on the 21st century world stage. We recommend a cosmopolitan approach for neuroethics to address and potentially resolve such issues with innovations such as BCI, suggesting guidelines and regulations for transnational implementation.}

abstract = {Background
Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is a concerning global health care issue, which is mainly caused by the uncertainty of patient arrivals, especially during the pandemic. Accurate forecasting of patient arrivals can allow health resource allocation in advance to reduce overcrowding. Currently, traditional data, such as historical patient visits, weather, holiday, and calendar, are primarily used to create forecasting models. However, data from an internet search engine (eg, Google) is less studied, although they can provide pivotal real-time surveillance information. The internet data can be employed to improve forecasting performance and provide early warning, especially during the epidemic. Moreover, possible nonlinearities between patient arrivals and these variables are often ignored.
Objective
This study aims to develop an intelligent forecasting system with machine learning models and internet search index to provide an accurate prediction of ED patient arrivals, to verify the effectiveness of the internet search index, and to explore whether nonlinear models can improve the forecasting accuracy.
Methods
Data on ED patient arrivals were collected from July 12, 2009, to June 27, 2010, the period of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. These included 139,910 ED visits in our collaborative hospital, which is one of the biggest public hospitals in Hong Kong. Traditional data were also collected during the same period. The internet search index was generated from 268 search queries on Google to comprehensively capture the information about potential patients. The relationship between the index and patient arrivals was verified by Pearson correlation coefficient, Johansen cointegration, and Granger causality. Linear and nonlinear models were then developed with the internet search index to predict patient arrivals. The accuracy and robustness were also examined.
Results
All models could accurately predict patient arrivals. The causality test indicated internet search index as a strong predictor of ED patient arrivals. With the internet search index, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the linear model reduced from 5.3% to 5.0% and from 24.44 to 23.18, respectively, whereas the MAPE and RMSE of the nonlinear model decreased even more, from 3.5% to 3% and from 16.72 to 14.55, respectively. Compared with each other, the experimental results revealed that the forecasting system with extreme learning machine, as well as the internet search index, had the best performance in both forecasting accuracy and robustness analysis.
Conclusions
The proposed forecasting system can make accurate, real-time prediction of ED patient arrivals. Compared with the static traditional variables, the internet search index significantly improves forecasting as a reliable predictor monitoring continuous behavior trend and sudden changes during the epidemic (P=.002). The nonlinear model performs better than the linear counterparts by capturing the dynamic relationship between the index and patient arrivals. Thus, the system can facilitate staff planning and workflow monitoring.}

The identification of performance obstacles is an effective way to study the accumulation of latent factors and risk hazards, and understand its implications in practice and behaviour of healthcare practitioners. In total, 123 performance obstacles were identified, of which the majority was related to environmental and organizational aspects. These findings show how the performance of nurse anaesthetists and their relation to medical equipment is continuously affected by more than user-related aspects. The contribution of systemic performance obstacles and coping strategies to enrich system design interventions and improve healthcare system is highlighted. In addition, methodological challenges of HFE research in low-resource settings related to professional culture and habits, and the potential of community ergonomics as a problem-managing approach are described.}

Several challenges face the successful execution of UICs, not the least of which is the cultural difference between the collaborators. Overcoming these challenges is the subject of several research initiatives that seek to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) that UIC consortiums can use to develop their internal capabilities and project management maturity. The challenges facing one large UIC have been studied in Portugal. Practitioners and researchers were involved in generating insights into how the UIC could be more effective. This paper presents some of these challenges facing the UIC and how they were addressed. It also offers early results into the CSFs deemed essential by researchers and practitioners based on their experience together over seven years. Top CSFs include senior management commitment, effective communication, stakeholder engagement, good leadership, clear and realistic goals, mutual trust and respect, interpersonal teamwork, and clear roles and responsibilities.}

abstract = {Background
The advancements and abundance of mobile phones and portable health devices have created an opportunity to use mobile health (mHealth) for population health systems. There is increasing evidence for the feasibility and acceptance of mHealth with Indigenous populations. Providing a synthesis of qualitative findings of mHealth with Indigenous populations will gain insights into the strengths and challenges to mHealth use in Indigenous populations.
Objective
This review aimed to identify and synthesize qualitative data pertaining to the experiences and perceptions of mHealth from the perspectives of end users (patients and service providers) living in the colonial settler democracies of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, the Pacific Islands, and the Sápmi region of northern Europe.
Methods
In May 2021, systematic searches of peer-reviewed, scientific papers were conducted across the 5 databases of PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Qualitative or mixed method studies were included where a mHealth intervention was the primary focus for responding to health challenges with Indigenous populations. Two authors independently screened papers for eligibility and assessed the risk of bias using a modified version of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. A meta-aggregative approach was used to analyze the findings of included studies.
Results
Seventeen papers met the eligibility criteria, 8 studies with patients, 7 studies with service providers, and 2 studies that included both patients and service providers. Studies were conducted in Australia (n=10), Canada (n=2), New Zealand (n=2), Papua New Guinea (n=1), the United States (n=1), and Samoa (n=1). Our interpretation of these qualitative findings shows commonalities between Indigenous patients’ and service providers’ perceptions of mHealth. We summarize our findings in six themes: (1) mHealth literacy, (2) mHealth as a facilitator for connection and support, (3) mHealth content needed to be culturally relevant, (4) mHealth security and confidentiality, (5) mHealth supporting rather than replacing service providers, and (6) workplace and organizational capacity.
Conclusions
This research suggests that mHealth can meet the needs of both patients and service providers when the mHealth intervention is culturally relevant, accounts for digital and health literacy, incorporates interactive components, is supported by workplaces, fits into health provider workflows, and meets security and confidentiality standards. Future mHealth research with Indigenous populations should partner with key representatives (eg, patients, service providers, and executive leaders) in the mHealth design appropriate to the purpose, people, setting, and delivery.}

These facial expressions are generally categorized into two kinds such as micro and macro-expressions. To detect the macro-expression effectively, an angle based pattern extraction models and Markov models are employed. But the micro-expression delivers more detailed information than the macro-expression. Other difficulties such as short durations and rapid spontaneous facial expression are induced due to the detection and analysis of the micro-expression. To solve these challenges, we work on techniques such as Active Shape Modeling (ACM), Random Walk (RW) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which helps to improve the overall performance effectively. The key points from the facial expression over the video frames are predicted using ASM and are spatially associated with the original face through the procrustes analysis. Then RW algorithm is used to learn the training features prior to ANN model. This RW is integrated with ANN model to improve the learning performance of micro-expression with minimum computation complexity. The experimental validation on two spontaneous micro-expression datasets such as Chinese Academy of Sciences Micro-Expression (CASME) and Spontaneous Micro-expression (SMIC) over the existing SVM classifiers shows its effectiveness in automatic micro-expression learning applications.}

abstract = {Existing theories on digitally enabled strategic agility have predominantly adopted a dynamic capability perspective, explaining how it fosters competitive advantage. However, such theories provide insufficient clarity on how organizations navigate the “equivocality” that arises from abundant but often unstructured and ambiguous information and signals to formulate an effective response to environmental dynamism. We address this literature gap by developing a novel organizational-sensemaking-based framework where digitally enabled strategic agility emerges from a combination of digital orientation, information governance, and digital transformation. We test the series of hypotheses depicted in the theoretical framework empirically by collecting survey data from the Australian healthcare sector. The statistical findings reveal that digital orientation influences digitally enabled strategic agility through the individual and serial mediation of information governance and digital transformation, with no direct impact observed. Our findings highlight the importance of organizational sensemaking in achieving effective responses to environmental changes, crucial for fully realizing digitally enabled strategic agility.}

abstract = {This paper presents a user-friendly tool, called MEMO GRAPH, for visualizing and navigating ontologies. Compared to related work, MEMO GRAPH is designed to be used by everyone, including ontology experts and users not familiar with ontologies. It provides an accessible and understandable user interface that follows the “design-for-all” philosophy. Precisely, it offers an Alzheimer's patients-friendly interface. The MEMO GRAPH ontology visualization tool is integrated in the CAPTAIN MEMO memory prosthesis and it is applied for visualizing a small-scale ontology (PersonLink) and a large-scale ontology (DBpedia). We discuss the encouraging results derived from the preliminary empirical evaluation, which confirms that MEMO GRAPH is an intuitive and usable ontology visualization tool.}
